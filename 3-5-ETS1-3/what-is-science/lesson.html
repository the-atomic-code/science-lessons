            <div class="image-caption">Science helps us understand and explore the world around us through many different activities and discoveries!</div>
        </div>

        <div class="definition-box">
            <strong>Science</strong> is the process of learning about the natural world through observation and experimentation. In science, evidence is the most important thing!
        </div>

        <h2>üåü Understanding Science</h2>
        
        <div class="content-with-image">
            <div class="text-content">
                <p>Have you ever wondered how things work in the world around you? Why do birds fly? How do plants grow? What makes electricity work? Science helps us answer these questions!</p>

                <p>Scientists study the natural world - from tiny insects to massive planets, from the food we eat to the air we breathe. They want to understand how everything works and connects together.</p>

                <div class="important-point">
                    <strong>Key Point:</strong> Scientists are very organized and methodical. They don't randomly mix things together like you might see in movies. Real scientists follow careful steps to learn about our world.

        </div>

        <h3>What Do Scientists Do?</h3>
        <p>Scientists ask meaningful questions that can be tested and analyzed. They use specific tools and methods to study the natural world. Most importantly, they make careful observations and record their findings so other scientists can repeat their investigations.</p>

        <div class="section-image image-container">
            <img src="diverse_science_activities.jpg" alt="Different types of science activities">
            <div class="image-caption">Science includes many different activities - from studying animals and plants to exploring chemistry and physics</div>
        </div>

        <div class="practice-list">
            <h3>üîç The Eight Scientific Practices</h3>
            <p>When scientists "do science," they use these practices:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Asking questions and defining problems</strong> - This is where science starts!</li>
                <li><strong>Developing and using models</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Planning and carrying out investigations</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Analyzing and interpreting data</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Using mathematics and computational thinking</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Constructing explanations</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Engaging in argument from evidence</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p><em>Scientists don't always do all of these steps, and they don't have to follow this exact order. It's more of a general approach to collect, analyze, and share information.</em></p>
        </div>

        <h2>üß™ The Importance of Evidence</h2>

        <div class="important-point">
            <strong>Remember:</strong> Evidence is #1 in science! The more evidence we have about an idea, the more confident we can be about it.
        </div>

        <h3>How Scientists Use Evidence</h3>
        <p>When scientists do investigations, they gather data to answer questions about the natural world. If they collect lots of data that supports their hypothesis (their educated guess), then the hypothesis might become a theory.</p>

        <p>Theories continue to be tested. Sometimes they become well-established because there's lots of evidence to support them. But sometimes, theories are thrown out because new evidence shows they might not be true.</p>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <strong>Important:</strong> Scientists must always be willing to examine new evidence and change their views. You must be willing to change your mind based on new evidence!
        </div>

        <h3>üåç How Scientific Ideas Change: The Earth Example</h3>
        
        <div class="side-by-side">
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="flat_earth.jpg" alt="Flat Earth concept illustration">
                <div class="image-caption"><strong>Old Belief:</strong> For centuries, people believed the Earth was flat because that's what it looked like to them</div>
            </div>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="earth_and_space.jpg" alt="Round Earth in space">
                <div class="image-caption"><strong>New Evidence:</strong> Better tools and observations showed scientists that Earth is actually round!</div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="fun-fact">
            <strong>üåç Fun Fact:</strong> This example shows how important it is to be willing to change our ideas when we find new evidence! Scientists used better tools, made more careful observations, and discovered the truth about Earth's shape.
        </div>

        <h2>üî¨ Controlled Experiments</h2>

        <div class="definition-box">
            <strong>Controlled Experiment:</strong> A scientific test where scientists only change one thing at a time to see what happens. This helps them know what caused the results.
        </div>

        <h3>Why Control Variables?</h3>
        <p>Imagine you're testing which type of soil helps plants grow best. You need to keep everything else the same:</p>
        
        <div class="example-box">
            <strong>What to keep the same (constant):</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Amount of water given to each plant</li>
                <li>Amount of sunlight each plant gets</li>
                <li>Size of the pots</li>
                <li>Type of seeds used</li>
                <li>Temperature where plants are kept</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>What to change (variable):</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Only the type of soil</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>If you change more than one thing at a time, you won't know which change caused the results!</p>

        <h3>Recording Data</h3>
        <div class="important-point">
            <strong>Why Record Data?</strong> Scientists record their observations and measurements so they can:
            <ul>
                <li>Remember what happened in their experiments</li>
                <li>Share their findings with other scientists</li>
                <li>Compare results from different trials</li>
                <li>Look for patterns in their results</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Repeating Tests</h3>
        <p>Scientists don't just do an experiment once. They repeat their tests multiple times to make sure their results are reliable. This is called doing multiple trials.</p>

        <div class="example-box">
            <strong>Example:</strong> If you're testing how far a paper airplane flies, you wouldn't throw it just once. You'd throw it many times and see what the average distance is. This gives you better, more trustworthy results!
        </div>

        <h2>üöÄ When Things Don't Work: Learning from Failure</h2>

        <p>Sometimes experiments don't work the way scientists expect. That's okay! When scientists find problems or failure points in their designs, they use this information to make improvements.</p>

        <div class="important-point">
            <strong>What Scientists Do When Things Fail:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Look at the data to understand what went wrong</li>
                <li>Identify which parts of their design need improvement</li>
                <li>Make changes to their design</li>
                <li>Test again to see if the changes work better</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Testing Prototypes</h3>
        <p>A prototype is an early model of something that scientists or engineers build to test their ideas. When testing prototypes:</p>

        <div class="example-box">
            <strong>Example Scenarios:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Testing a model boat:</strong> Change one thing at a time (like the sail size) while keeping everything else the same (water temperature, starting position, etc.)</li>
                <li><strong>Testing a bridge design:</strong> Keep the materials and testing conditions the same each time to see which design holds the most weight</li>
                <li><strong>Testing a solar oven:</strong> Measure temperature changes while keeping the amount of sunlight and food the same</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>‚ùå What is NOT Science?</h2>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <strong>Not Science:</strong> Anytime someone makes claims without evidence, they are not doing science.
        </div>

        <div class="content-with-image">
            <div class="text-content">
                <p>Many things around us might seem like science, but they're not:</p>

                <div class="example-box">
                    <strong>Examples of Non-Science:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Palm reading</strong> - No evidence that palm lines predict the future</li>
                        <li><strong>Magic tricks</strong> - Based on illusion, not evidence</li>
                        <li><strong>Magic 8 balls</strong> - Random answers, not based on evidence</li>
                        <li><strong>Astrology</strong> - Claims that star positions affect human behavior, but no evidence supports this</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="important-point">
                    <strong>Remember:</strong> <span class="vocabulary-term">Astronomy</span> (the scientific study of space) is science, but <span class="vocabulary-term">astrology</span> (predicting personality from star positions) is NOT science because there's no evidence to support it.
                </div>

            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>üéØ Making Valid Scientific Claims</h2>

        <div class="definition-box">
            <strong>Valid Scientific Claim:</strong> A statement that is supported by evidence collected through proper scientific methods.
        </div>

        <p>For a claim to be valid in science, it must:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Be supported by evidence</li>
            <li>Be based on controlled experiments or careful observations</li>
            <li>Be repeatable by other scientists</li>
            <li>Be open to change if new evidence is found</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>üåç Science is a Team Effort & Amazing Discoveries</h2>

        <p>Science is not done by just one person. Scientists work together and share their discoveries. For example, many scientists before and after Benjamin Franklin conducted experiments to better understand electricity. Each scientist built on the work of others.</p>

        <h2>üéØ Remember These Key Points</h2>

        <div class="important-point">
            <ul>
                <li>Science starts with asking questions about the natural world</li>
                <li>Evidence is the most important part of science</li>
                <li>Scientists must be willing to change their ideas when new evidence is found</li>
                <li>Controlled experiments only change one variable at a time</li>
                <li>Scientists record data and repeat tests to get reliable results</li>
                <li>When designs fail, scientists use that information to make improvements</li>
                <li>Valid scientific claims must be supported by evidence</li>
                <li>Science is different from non-science because it requires evidence</li>

            <strong>üåü You Can Be a Scientist Too!</strong><br>
            Every time you ask "Why?" or "How?" about something in nature, and then try to find the answer through careful observation or testing, you're thinking like a scientist!
