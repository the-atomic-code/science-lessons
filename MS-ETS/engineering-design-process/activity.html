    <h1>Engineering Design Process: Paper Table Challenge</h1><p>Welcome to today's exciting science lesson where we'll learn about the Engineering Design Process while taking on a fun challenge! Engineers use a special process to solve problems and create amazing solutions. Today, you'll be engineers tasked with building a paper table strong enough to hold books!</p>

<h2>What is the Engineering Design Process?</h2>

<p>The engineering design process is a series of steps that engineers use to guide them when solving problems. While there are many versions of this process (some with 6 steps, others with up to 19 steps!), they all follow three main phases:</p>

<div class="phase">
    <h3>Phase 1: Define the Problem</h3>
    <p>In this first phase, engineers identify exactly what problem they need to solve and understand the requirements (criteria) and limitations (constraints) of their solution.</p>
</div>

<div class="phase">
    <h3>Phase 2: Develop Possible Solutions</h3>
    <p>During this phase, engineers brainstorm ideas, research existing solutions, sketch designs, build models, and gather information that will help them develop potential solutions.</p>
</div>

<div class="phase">
    <h3>Phase 3: Optimize the Design Solution</h3>
    <p>In the final phase, engineers test their solutions, analyze the results, and make improvements until their design successfully meets all the criteria and constraints.</p>
</div>

<p>It's important to know that the engineering design process is <strong>iterative</strong>, meaning engineers don't simply go through these steps once in order. They often jump back and forth between steps and repeat parts of the process as needed!</p>

<h2>Paper Table Challenge</h2>

<p>Today, we're going to apply the engineering design process to build a table made of newspaper that can hold a book 15 centimeters above a surface. Let's break down our challenge using the three phases:</p>

<div class="materials">
    <h3>Materials Needed:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Up to 20 sheets of newspaper</li>
        <li>Up to 2 meters of tape</li>
        <li>3 heavy books for testing</li>
        <li>Ruler or measuring tape</li>
        <li>Scissors (optional)</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="activity">
    <h3>Phase 1: Define the Problem</h3>
    <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Design and build a table using only newspaper and tape that can hold a book at least 15 centimeters above the surface.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Criteria (requirements for success):</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The table must be at least 15 cm tall</li>
        <li>The table must support the weight of at least one heavy book</li>
        <li>The table must be stable and not collapse</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Constraints (limitations):</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use only up to 20 sheets of newspaper</li>
        <li>Use only up to 2 meters of tape</li>
        <li>Complete the challenge within the given time (45-60 minutes)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="tip">
        <p><strong>Activity Step:</strong> Take 5 minutes to write down the problem, criteria, and constraints in your own words. Think about what makes a table strong and stable.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="activity">
    <h3>Phase 2: Develop Possible Solutions</h3>
    
    <p><strong>Brainstorming:</strong> In this phase, come up with as many ideas as possible. Don't judge any ideas yet - just get them all on paper!</p>
    
    <p><strong>Research:</strong> Think about tables you've seen. What shapes make structures strong? What gives stability?</p>
    
    <div class="tip">
        <p><strong>Engineering Tip:</strong> Triangles are one of the strongest shapes in engineering because they distribute weight evenly. Cylinders (rolled paper) can also be very strong when stood vertically.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p><strong>Activity Steps:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Spend 10 minutes sketching at least 3 different table designs</li>
        <li>For each design, note:
            <ul>
                <li>How many sheets of newspaper you'll need</li>
                <li>How you'll create the legs and table top</li>
                <li>Where you'll use tape and how much</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Choose your best design to build first</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<div class="activity">
    <h3>Phase 3: Optimize the Design Solution</h3>
    
    <p>This is where you'll build, test, and improve your design.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Building your prototype:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Construct your table according to your design</li>
        <li>Measure to ensure it's at least 15 cm tall</li>
        <li>Carefully place one book on top to test</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p><strong>Testing and improving:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>What happened when you placed the book on your table?</li>
        <li>If it collapsed, where did the failure occur?</li>
        <li>How could you strengthen that part?</li>
        <li>If it worked, try adding a second book. Can your design hold more weight?</li>
    </ol>
    
    <div class="tip">
        <p><strong>Remember:</strong> Failure is part of the engineering process! Real engineers rarely get things perfect on the first try. Each test gives you valuable information to improve your design.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p><strong>Optimization Steps:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Based on your test results, modify your design to make it stronger</li>
        <li>You might need to:
            <ul>
                <li>Add more support to the legs</li>
                <li>Change the shape of your table</li>
                <li>Reinforce weak points with additional newspaper or strategic taping</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Test again with the books</li>
        <li>Continue improving until your design successfully meets all criteria</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<div class="challenge">
    <h3>Extra Challenges:</h3>
    <p>If your table successfully holds one book, try these additional challenges:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>How many books can your table hold?</li>
        <li>Can you redesign using fewer sheets of newspaper?</li>
        <li>Can you make your table taller while still supporting a book?</li>
        <li>Can you design a table that can be disassembled and reassembled?</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<h2>Reflection Questions</h2>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Which part of the engineering design process did you find most challenging? Why?</strong>
        <p><em>Answers will vary. Some students might say defining the problem was challenging because they had to think about all the requirements. Others might say optimizing was challenging because they had to figure out what went wrong and how to fix it.</em></p>
    </li>
    
    <li><strong>What shapes or structures made your table strongest?</strong>
        <p><em>Answers will vary but might include: triangular supports, cylindrical/rolled paper legs, cross-bracing between legs, or a reinforced tabletop.</em></p>
    </li>
    
    <li><strong>If you were to do this challenge again with the same materials, what would you do differently?</strong>
        <p><em>Answers will vary. Students might mention different folding techniques, better use of tape, different leg arrangements, etc.</em></p>
    </li>
    
    <li><strong>How is the engineering design process similar to how you solve problems in everyday life?</strong>
        <p><em>Answers might include: In everyday life, we often need to identify problems, think of possible solutions, try them out, and make improvements if they don't work perfectly the first time.</em></p>
    </li>
    
    <li><strong>Name another problem that could be solved using the engineering design process.</strong>
        <p><em>Answers might include: designing a better backpack, creating a water filter, building a bridge out of popsicle sticks, designing an app, creating a system to keep school supplies organized, etc.</em></p>
    </li>
</ol>
