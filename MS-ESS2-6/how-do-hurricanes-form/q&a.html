<div class="question">
    <div class="question-text">Q1: Where and when do most hurricanes in the Northern Hemisphere typically form?</div>
    <button id="b1" class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('1')">Show Answer</button>
    <div id="a1" class="answer">
    Most hurricanes form near the equator off the coast of West Africa during the official hurricane season (June 1st to November 30th). This specific location and timing are crucial because they provide the perfect conditions for hurricane formation! 🌍
    </div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <div class="question-text">Q2: What are the three essential conditions needed for hurricane formation?</div>
    <button id="b2" class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('2')">Show Answer</button>
    <div id="a2" class="answer">
    The three crucial conditions are:<br>
    1. Ocean surface temperature of at least 79°F (26°C) 🌡️<br>
    2. High pressure above the hurricane ⬆️<br>
    3. Low wind shear 💨<br>
    These conditions work together like ingredients in a recipe to create the perfect environment for hurricane formation!

<div class="question">
    <div class="question-text">Q3: Explain how hurricanes work as "giant engines."</div>
    <button id="b3" class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('3')">Show Answer</button>
    <div id="a3" class="answer">
    Think of hurricanes as nature's heat engines! Here's how they work:<br>
    1. Warm moist air rises from the ocean surface ⬆️<br>
    2. This creates a low-pressure system below 📉<br>
    3. Surrounding high-pressure air moves in ➡️<br>
    4. New air warms up and rises ⬆️<br>
    5. Rising air cools and forms clouds ☁️<br>
    6. The system continues to spin and grow, powered by ocean heat and evaporation 🌀

<div class="question">
    <div class="question-text">Q4: What is the Coriolis effect and how does it influence hurricanes?</div>
    <button id="b4" class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('4')">Show Answer</button>
    <div id="a4" class="answer">
    The Coriolis effect is caused by Earth's rotation and makes hurricanes spin counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere. It's like a giant merry-go-round effect that curves moving air to the right in the Northern Hemisphere, creating that distinctive spiral pattern we see in satellite images! 🌀

<div class="question">
    <div class="question-text">Q5: How are hurricanes classified by wind speed?</div>
    <button id="b5" class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('5')">Show Answer</button>
    <div id="a5" class="answer">
    Hurricane classification by wind speed:<br>
    - Minimum for hurricane status: 74 mph 💨<br>
    - Category 1: 74-95 mph<br>
    - Category 2: 96-110 mph<br>
    - Category 3: 111-129 mph<br>
    - Category 4: 130-156 mph<br>
    - Category 5: Greater than 157 mph 🌪️

<div class="question">
    <div class="question-text">Q6: Why is September the peak hurricane month?</div>
    <button id="b6" class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('6')">Show Answer</button>
    <div id="a6" class="answer">
    September is hurricane season's superstar month! This is because ocean surface temperatures reach their highest levels after months of summer heating. These warm waters provide maximum energy for hurricane formation and intensification. It's like the ocean is a giant battery that's fully charged! 🌊
    </div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <div class="question-text">Q7: How do trade winds affect hurricane movement and development?</div>
    <button id="b7" class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('7')">Show Answer</button>
    <div id="a7" class="answer">
    Trade winds are like nature's conveyor belt! They blow across the equator and help push hurricanes along their path westward. These consistent winds play a crucial role in guiding hurricanes across the Atlantic Ocean and influencing their trajectory. 🌬️
    </div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <div class="question-text">Q8: What happens to water vapor during hurricane formation?</div>
    <button id="b8" class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('8')">Show Answer</button>
    <div id="a8" class="answer">
    Water vapor is like the hurricane's fuel! As warm, moist air rises, it cools and the water vapor condenses to form clouds. This process releases heat energy, which further strengthens the hurricane. It's a continuous cycle of energy transfer that keeps the hurricane powered up! 💧
    </div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <div class="question-text">Q9: How does the low-pressure system in a hurricane form and what role does it play?</div>
    <button id="b9" class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('9')">Show Answer</button>
    <div id="a9" class="answer">
    The low-pressure system is like a vacuum at the hurricane's center! It forms when warm air rises, creating a space that surrounding air rushes to fill. This process is crucial because:<br>
    1. It maintains the hurricane's circulation 🌀<br>
    2. Creates the characteristic "eye" of the hurricane 👁️<br>
    3. Helps draw in more warm, moist air to fuel the storm 💨
    </div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <div class="question-text">Q10: What role does ocean temperature play in hurricane maintenance?</div>
    <button id="b10" class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('10')">Show Answer</button>
    <div id="a10" class="answer">
    Ocean temperature is like the hurricane's power source! To maintain its strength, a hurricane needs:<br>
    - Constant water temperature above 79°F (26°C) 🌡️<br>
    - Continuous supply of warm water to provide energy<br>
    - Sufficient ocean depth to maintain warm temperatures<br>
    If the hurricane moves over cooler water or land, it will begin to weaken! 🌊

<div class="question">
    <div class="question-text">Q11: How does the process of evaporation and condensation contribute to hurricane intensity?</div>
    <button id="b11" class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('11')">Show Answer</button>
    <div id="a11" class="answer">
    Think of this as nature's energy cycle! Here's how it works:<br>
    1. Sun heats the ocean surface ☀️<br>
    2. Water evaporates and carries heat energy upward 💨<br>
    3. Water vapor condenses in clouds, releasing heat energy ☁️<br>
    4. Released heat energy powers the hurricane's winds 🌪️<br>
    This continuous cycle keeps the hurricane engine running!

<div class="question">
    <div class="question-text">Q12: What makes hurricanes different from other storm systems?</div>
    <button id="b12" class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('12')">Show Answer</button>
    <div id="a12" class="answer">
    Hurricanes are special because they:<br>
    1. Form only over warm ocean waters 🌊<br>
    2. Have a well-defined center (eye) 👁️<br>
    3. Maintain their strength through ocean heat energy 🌡️<br>
    4. Have organized circulation patterns 🌀<br>
    5. Can last for many days or even weeks! ⏱️
