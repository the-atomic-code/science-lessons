    <h1>Climate Zones & Ocean Currents</h1>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Introduction to Climate Zones and Ocean Currents</h2>
        <p>Our planet has a remarkable system for distributing heat and moisture. In this lesson, we'll explore how the Earth's different climate zones form and how ocean currents play a vital role in regulating global temperatures.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Ocean currents</strong> are directed, continuous movements of ocean water. They can be found on the ocean's surface and in its depths, operating at local or global scales. These currents are primarily driven by three factors: winds, water density differences, and tides. Additionally, sea floor features and coastlines can influence how these currents move, affecting their speed and direction.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <div>
                <img src="heat_zones_and_coriolis_effct.jpg" alt="Heat zones and Coriolis effect on Earth">
                <p class="image-caption">Global heat distribution and circulation patterns influenced by the Coriolis effect</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>The Coriolis Effect: Why Winds and Currents Curve</h2>
        <p>Have you ever wondered why winds don't just travel in straight lines? The answer lies in a fascinating phenomenon called the Coriolis effect.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <p>The <strong>Coriolis effect</strong> is a global wind pattern caused by Earth's rotation. As our planet rotates on its axis every 24 hours, different latitudes actually move at different speeds!</p>
            <p>Think about it this way:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Earth's poles have a smaller distance to travel during rotation, so they move at a slower speed</li>
                <li>The Equator has the furthest distance to travel, so it moves the fastest</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When air or water moves from one latitude to another, it continues at its original speed. But the Earth underneath is moving at a different speed, creating a curve or "deflection" in the path of the moving air or water.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <div>
                <img src="Coriolis-Effect.jpg" alt="The Coriolis Effect">
                <p class="image-caption">The Coriolis effect causes deflection of air and water currents due to Earth's rotation</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <p>This deflection follows a consistent pattern:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In the Northern Hemisphere, air and water currents deflect to the right</li>
            <li>In the Southern Hemisphere, they deflect to the left</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="activity">
            <h3>Think About It!</h3>
            <p>Imagine you're standing at the North Pole and throw a ball toward the equator. As the ball travels south, it passes over areas that are rotating faster than at the pole. From your perspective, the ball would appear to curve to the right of its target!</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>This is why prevailing winds in the Northern Hemisphere typically blow from west to east - they're being deflected to the right by the Coriolis effect as they travel. This same principle affects ocean currents, creating circular patterns called gyres that typically flow clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and counterclockwise in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Light Intensity and Solar Energy</h2>
        <p>The amount of solar energy reaching different parts of Earth varies tremendously and is a major factor in determining climate zones.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Light intensity</strong> measures how much energy hits a surface. Light from the Sun travels in a straight line until it hits something that may block or reflect it. When sunlight hits Earth's surface at a 90° angle (perpendicular), it transfers the maximum amount of energy to that area.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <div>
                <img src="Sunlight_Angle_Earth_Atmosphere_Effect.jpg" alt="Sunlight angle effect on Earth">
                <p class="image-caption">How the angle of sunlight affects energy distribution on Earth's surface</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <p>The angle at which sunlight strikes Earth's surface depends on latitude:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Near the Equator, sunlight strikes at a more direct angle (close to 90°), concentrating energy in a smaller area</li>
            <li>Near the poles, sunlight strikes at a more shallow angle, spreading the same amount of energy over a larger area</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <div>
                <img src="heat_zones_and_latitudes.jpg" alt="Heat zones and latitudes">
                <p class="image-caption">Distribution of heat zones across different latitudes on Earth</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            <h3>Solar Energy Distribution Example</h3>
            <p>Imagine shining a flashlight directly down on a table (like sun at the equator) versus shining it at an angle (like sun at the poles). When the light hits at an angle, the same amount of light energy gets spread over a larger area, making each part of that area receive less energy and appear dimmer.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>This difference in solar energy distribution is the primary reason why the equator is warmer than the poles and why we have distinct climate zones across the planet.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Earth's Major Climate Zones</h2>
        <p>Earth's surface is divided into several major climate zones based primarily on latitude. Let's explore the three main zones and their characteristics.</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <div>
                <img src="climate_zones.jpg" alt="Earth's climate zones">
                <p class="image-caption">Major climate zones of Earth showing the Tropical, Temperate, and Polar regions</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <h3>1. Tropical Zone</h3>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p>The <strong>Tropical Zone</strong> is found in the middle of the globe, between the Tropic of Cancer (23.5° N latitude) and the Tropic of Capricorn (23.5° S latitude), with the Equator in the center. This zone:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Makes up about 36% of Earth's landmass</li>
                <li>Is home to approximately one-third of the world's population</li>
                <li>Maintains warm temperatures year-round, averaging 25-28°C (77-82°F)</li>
                <li>Receives the most direct sunlight of any zone</li>
                <li>Has only two seasons: wet and dry (instead of the four seasons found elsewhere)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h3>2. Temperate Zone</h3>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p>The <strong>Temperate Zone</strong> lies between the tropics and the polar regions, roughly from 30° to 60° latitude in both hemispheres. This "mid-latitude" zone:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Features a greater variety of climates than other zones</li>
                <li>Shows significant differences between coastal and inland areas</li>
                <li>Generally experiences four distinct seasons</li>
                <li>Has moderate temperatures compared to the extremes of tropical and polar zones</li>
                <li>Contains most of North America, Europe, and parts of Asia</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="image-container">

                <p class="image-caption">A temperate forest ecosystem typical of mid-latitude regions</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <h3>3. Polar Zone</h3>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p>The <strong>Polar Zones</strong> extend from 66.5° latitude to the poles in both hemispheres. These regions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Receive the least direct sunlight throughout the year</li>
                <li>Contain two distinct subregions: ice caps and tundra</li>
                <li>Experience extremely cold temperatures most of the year</li>
                <li>Have unique differences between north and south:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The <strong>North Polar Zone</strong> is dominated by the Arctic Ocean with scattered islands belonging to various nations</li>
                    <li>The <strong>South Polar Zone</strong> contains Antarctica, a single large landmass that doesn't belong to any individual nation</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="activity">
            <h3>Location Matters: Same Latitude, Different Climate</h3>
            <p>Two cities at the same latitude can have drastically different climates! For example, London, UK and Calgary, Canada are at similar latitudes, but London has a much milder climate. This is because London is influenced by the warm Gulf Stream current, while Calgary is in a continental interior far from major ocean influences.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Ocean Currents: Earth's Heat Distribution System</h2>
        <p>Ocean currents serve as Earth's natural heating and cooling system, redistributing heat from the equator toward the poles.</p>
        
        <h3>What Drives Ocean Currents?</h3>
        <p>Three main factors drive the movement of ocean currents:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Winds</strong> - Surface currents are primarily driven by prevailing winds</li>
            <li><strong>Water Density</strong> - Differences in water density create deep ocean currents</li>
            <li><strong>Tides</strong> - The gravitational pull of the moon and sun creates tidal movements</li>
        </ol>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Density-Driven Currents: The Ocean Conveyor Belt</h3>
            <p>Water density varies based on two key factors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature</strong> - Cold water is denser than warm water</li>
                <li><strong>Salinity</strong> - Saltier water is denser than less salty water</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When water becomes colder or saltier, it becomes denser and sinks to the ocean floor. This sinking water is replaced by surface water, creating a continuous circulation system. This global "ocean conveyor belt" moves enormous amounts of heat around the planet.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Ocean currents significantly impact coastal climates. For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Warm currents (like the Gulf Stream) bring milder conditions to adjacent land areas</li>
            <li>Cold currents (like the California Current) bring cooler conditions to nearby coasts</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="example">
            <h3>Ocean Currents and Coastal Climate Example</h3>
            <p>Norway, despite being at the same latitude as Alaska, has a much milder climate because of the warm North Atlantic Current bringing heat from the tropics. Meanwhile, San Francisco remains cool in summer partly because of the cold California Current flowing southward along the west coast of North America.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Land and Water: Different Heating Rates</h2>
        <p>Land and water heat up and cool down at different rates, which creates important climate patterns.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Key differences:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Land heats up and cools down quickly</li>
                <li>Water heats up and cools down slowly</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>These differences create several important climate effects:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Coastal vs. Continental Climates</strong> - Areas near oceans have milder temperatures year-round, while continental interiors experience more extreme temperature changes</li>
            <li><strong>Sea and Land Breezes</strong> - During the day, land heats faster, causing air to rise and creating a sea breeze. At night, land cools faster, creating a land breeze</li>
            <li><strong>Seasonal Lag</strong> - Oceans take longer to warm up in summer and longer to cool down in winter, which delays seasonal temperature changes in coastal areas</li>
        </ol>
        
        <div class="activity">
            <h3>Think About It!</h3>
            <p>Why do desert regions often have extreme temperature differences between day and night, while coastal areas maintain relatively stable temperatures? The answer lies in the difference between how quickly land versus water heats and cools!</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Atmospheric Circulation and Precipitation Patterns</h2>
        <p>The movement of air in the atmosphere creates distinct patterns of rising and sinking air that influence rainfall and vegetation worldwide.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Key principle:</strong> Warm air rises, cool air sinks. As air rises, it cools and water vapor condenses, often forming clouds and precipitation. As air sinks, it warms and becomes drier.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>How Rising and Sinking Air Creates Different Environments</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rising Air → Rain → Rainforests</strong>: Near the equator, intense heating causes air to rise, creating a band of low pressure. As this warm, moist air rises, it cools, and water vapor condenses to form clouds and heavy rainfall. This consistent rainfall supports lush rainforests.</li>
            <li><strong>Sinking Air → Dry Conditions → Deserts</strong>: Around 30° north and south latitude, air that rose at the equator has cooled and begins to sink. As this air descends, it warms and its relative humidity decreases, creating dry conditions. This is why many of the world's major deserts are located at these latitudes.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="example">
            <h3>Mountain Effects on Climate</h3>
            <p>Mountains can create dramatically different climate zones on their windward and leeward sides:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Windward side</strong> (facing prevailing winds): As air is forced up the mountain, it cools and releases moisture as precipitation, creating wetter conditions</li>
                <li><strong>Leeward side</strong> (away from prevailing winds): Air descending the mountain warms and dries out, creating a "rain shadow" with much drier conditions</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This explains why many mountains have lush forests on one side and dry conditions on the other!</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Climate Change and Global Patterns</h2>
        <p>Our understanding of climate zones and ocean currents is particularly important today as we witness changes in these systems due to global climate change.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <p>Rising global temperatures are affecting established climate patterns in several ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Shifting the boundaries between climate zones</li>
                <li>Altering ocean current patterns and strengths</li>
                <li>Changing precipitation patterns in many regions</li>
                <li>Affecting the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>Scientists use their knowledge of how these systems normally function to understand and predict how they might change in the future. This understanding is crucial for developing strategies to address and adapt to changing climate conditions.</p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>We've explored the fascinating world of climate zones and ocean currents, discovering how Earth's rotation, the angle of sunlight, atmospheric circulation, and ocean currents all work together to create our planet's diverse climate patterns.</p>
        
        <p>Key takeaways include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Coriolis effect causes winds and currents to curve differently in the Northern and Southern hemispheres</li>
            <li>Earth has three major climate zones (Tropical, Temperate, and Polar) based primarily on latitude</li>
            <li>The angle of sunlight affects how much solar energy reaches different parts of Earth's surface</li>
            <li>Ocean currents redistribute heat globally and are driven by winds, density differences, and tides</li>
            <li>Land and water heat and cool at different rates, creating coastal and continental climate patterns</li>
            <li>Rising air creates precipitation and rainforests; sinking air creates dry conditions and deserts</li>
            <li>Mountains create different climate conditions on their windward and leeward sides</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Understanding these global patterns helps us make sense of why different regions experience such different climates and how all these systems interconnect to create Earth's amazing climate diversity.</p>
