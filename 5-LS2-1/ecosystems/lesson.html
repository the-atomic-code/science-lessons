    <h1>üåé Exploring Earth's Amazing Ecosystems üåé</h1>
    
    <div class="ecosystem-card">
        <p>Hello, young scientists! Today we're going on an exciting journey across our planet to explore different ecosystems! An ecosystem is a community of living organisms (plants, animals, and microorganisms) together with the nonliving components of their environment (like air, water, soil, and sunlight), all interacting as a system. Earth has many different types of ecosystems, each with its own special characteristics and incredible adaptations. Let's discover them together!</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Major Ecosystem Types</h2>
    
    <h3>Terrestrial Ecosystems (Land-Based)</h3>
    
    <div class="ecosystem-card">
        <h3>üèîÔ∏è Tundra Ecosystems</h3>
        <p>Tundras are cold, treeless regions found in the Arctic and on top of high mountains. Places like the Bering Land Bridge in Alaska, the Tibetan Plateau in Asia, and Peary Land in Greenland are famous tundra ecosystems.</p>
        
        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin: 15px 0;">
            <img src="tundra-1.jpg" alt="Tundra ecosystem" style="width: 48%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;">
            <img src="tundra-2.jpg" alt="Tundra landscape" style="width: 48%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;">
        </div>
        
        <div class="fact-box">
            <p><strong>Tundra Facts:</strong> The ground in tundra ecosystems has a layer of permanently frozen soil called <strong>permafrost</strong>. During the brief summer, only the top layer of soil thaws!</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="ecosystem-card">
        <h3>üå≥ Temperate Deciduous Forests</h3>
        <p>These forests have trees that lose their leaves in fall and regrow them in spring. Examples include Steigerwald Forest in Germany, Catoctin Mountain Park in the United States, and Bia≈Çowie≈ºa Forest in Poland/Belarus.</p>
        
        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin: 15px 0;">
            <img src="temperate-decidious-forest-1.jpg" alt="Temperate deciduous forest" style="width: 32%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;">
            <img src="temperate-decidious-forest-2.jpg" alt="Temperate deciduous forest" style="width: 32%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;">
            <img src="temperate-decidious-forest-3.jpg" alt="Temperate deciduous forest" style="width: 32%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;">
        </div>
        
        <div class="plant-adaptation">
            <p><strong>Plant Adaptation:</strong> Deciduous trees shed their leaves in winter to conserve energy during the cold months when there isn't enough sunlight for effective photosynthesis.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="ecosystem-card">
        <h3>üèúÔ∏è Desert Ecosystems</h3>
        <p>Deserts are hot, dry places that receive very little rainfall. The Great Victoria Desert in Australia, the Sonoran Desert in North America, the Sahara Desert in Africa, and the Taklamakan Desert in Asia are some of Earth's major deserts.</p>
        
        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin: 15px 0;">
            <img src="desert-1.jpg" alt="Desert ecosystem" style="width: 48%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;">
            <img src="desert-2.jpg" alt="Desert landscape" style="width: 48%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;">
        </div>
        
        <div class="animal-adaptation">
            <p><strong>Animal Adaptation:</strong> Many desert animals are nocturnal (active at night) to avoid the extreme daytime heat. Some, like the kangaroo rat, can survive without drinking water by getting moisture from the seeds they eat!</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="ecosystem-card">
        <h3>üåæ Prairie/Grassland Ecosystems</h3>
        <p>Prairies are areas dominated by grasses rather than trees or shrubs. Buffalo Gap National Grassland and Tallgrass Prairie in North America are excellent examples of grassland ecosystems.</p>
        
        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin: 15px 0;">
            <img src="grassland-1.jpg" alt="Grassland ecosystem" style="width: 48%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;">
            <img src="grassland-2.jpg" alt="Grassland landscape" style="width: 48%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;">
        </div>
        
        <div class="fun-fact">
            <p><strong>WOW Fact:</strong> Prairie grasses can have roots that extend more than 15 feet deep into the soil! These deep root systems help the grasses survive drought and fire.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="ecosystem-card">
        <h3>üå≤ Taiga/Boreal Forest Ecosystems</h3>
        <p>Taigas are forests of coniferous trees (like pine and spruce) found in northern regions with long, cold winters. The Eastern Siberian Taiga in Russia and Mount Rainier National Park in the United States contain taiga ecosystems.</p>
        
        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin: 15px 0;">
            <img src="taiga-1.jpg" alt="Taiga forest ecosystem" style="width: 48%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;">
            <img src="taiga-2.jpg" alt="Taiga forest landscape" style="width: 48%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;">
        </div>
        
        <div class="plant-adaptation">
            <p><strong>Plant Adaptation:</strong> Coniferous trees have needle-like leaves covered in a waxy coating that helps prevent water loss during freezing temperatures.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="ecosystem-card">
        <h3>üå¥ Rainforest Ecosystems</h3>
        <p>Rainforests are dense forests with high rainfall and incredible biodiversity. The Amazon Rainforest, which includes Yasuni National Park in Ecuador, is the world's largest tropical rainforest.</p>
        
        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin: 15px 0;">
            <img src="tropical-rainforest-1.jpg" alt="Tropical rainforest ecosystem" style="width: 48%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;">
            <img src="tropical-rainforest-2.jpg" alt="Rainforest landscape" style="width: 48%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;">
        </div>
        
        <div class="fact-box">
            <p><strong>Rainforest Facts:</strong> Even though rainforests cover less than 7% of Earth's land surface, they're home to more than 50% of the world's plant and animal species!</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Aquatic Ecosystems (Water-Based)</h3>
    
    <div class="water-section">
        <h3>üåä Freshwater Ecosystems</h3>
        
        <div class="ecosystem-card">
            <h4>Standing-Freshwater Ecosystems</h4>
            <p>These include lakes and ponds where water doesn't flow much. They're home to many species of fish, plants, and microscopic organisms.</p>

    <h3>Water Characteristics</h3>
    
    <div class="water-section">
        <h4>Water Movement</h4>
        <p>Water can be flowing (like in rivers and streams) or still (like in lakes and ponds). The movement of water affects which organisms can live there and how nutrients are distributed.</p>
        
        <h4>Water Salinity</h4>
        <p>Water can be freshwater (contains very little salt, like lakes and rivers), saltwater (contains high amounts of salt, like oceans), or brackish water (a mixture of fresh and salt water, like in estuaries).</p>
        
        <h4>Oxygen Levels</h4>
        <p>The amount of dissolved oxygen in water decreases with depth. This is why different types of aquatic organisms live at different depths in lakes and oceans.</p>
        
        <h4>Nutrient Content</h4>
        <p>Some aquatic ecosystems, like estuaries, are very nutrient-rich, while others, like the open ocean, have fewer nutrients available.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Precipitation Patterns</h2>
    
    <div class="ecosystem-card">
        <h3>Desert Precipitation</h3>
        <p>Deserts receive very little rainfall, often less than 10 inches (25 cm) per year. Some deserts may go years without rain!</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="ecosystem-card">
        <h3>Cold Mountain Areas</h3>
        <p>High mountain ecosystems may receive precipitation as snow year-round, creating unique habitats for specialized plants and animals.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="ecosystem-card">
        <h3>Seasonal Precipitation</h3>
        <p>Many ecosystems have distinct wet and dry seasons. For example, tropical rainforests have a wet season with daily rainfall and a relatively drier season.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="ecosystem-card">
        <h3>Flooding and Draining Cycles</h3>
        <p>Intertidal zones experience daily flooding and draining with the tides. Some wetlands have seasonal flooding cycles that are crucial for their ecosystem health.</p>

    <h3>Other Physical Features</h3>
    
    <div class="ecosystem-card">
        <h4>Water Coverage</h4>
        <p>Some ecosystems, like swamps and marshes, have seasonal water coverage patterns. Areas may be flooded during rainy seasons and dry during other parts of the year.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="ecosystem-card">
        <h4>Depth in Aquatic Ecosystems</h4>
        <p>Depth creates different zones in aquatic ecosystems, each with its own light levels, temperature, pressure, and organisms. The deepest ocean trenches are more than 36,000 feet (11,000 meters) deep!</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Vegetation</h2>
    
    <h3>Plant Adaptations</h3>
    
    <div class="plant-adaptation">
        <h4>Tundra Plants</h4>
        <p>Tundra plants are small and grow close to the ground to avoid cold winds. They can photosynthesize in low temperatures and light conditions.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="plant-adaptation">
        <h4>Desert Plants</h4>
        <p>Cacti and other desert plants store water in their tissues. Many have spines instead of leaves to reduce water loss and protect from animals. Some desert plants have very deep roots to reach underground water.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="plant-adaptation">
        <h4>Taiga (Boreal Forest) Plants</h4>
        <p>Coniferous trees have needle-like leaves that don't fall off in winter. Their cone shape helps snow slide off rather than accumulating and breaking branches.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="plant-adaptation">
        <h4>Temperate Forest Plants</h4>
        <p>Deciduous trees shed leaves in winter to conserve energy. Forest floor plants often bloom in early spring before the tree canopy blocks sunlight.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="plant-adaptation">
        <h4>Aquatic Plants</h4>
        <p>Some aquatic plants float on the surface, some are rooted but have leaves that reach the surface, and others live completely underwater. They have special tissues filled with air to help them float.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="plant-adaptation">
        <h4>Mangroves</h4>
        <p>Mangrove trees grow in coastal saltwater and have special roots that stick up out of the water to get oxygen. They can filter salt out of the water they absorb.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Animal Adaptations</h2>
    
    <div class="animal-adaptation">
        <h4>Tundra Animals</h4>
        <p>Arctic foxes have small ears to prevent heat loss and white fur that provides camouflage in snow. Many tundra animals hibernate or migrate during the harsh winter.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="animal-adaptation">
        <h4>Desert Animals</h4>
        <p>Camels can go for long periods without water and have special nostrils that recapture moisture when they exhale. Desert rodents often have highly efficient kidneys that conserve water.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="animal-adaptation">
        <h4>Forest Animals</h4>
        <p>Many forest animals, like squirrels, build nests in trees for protection. Some, like bears, hibernate during winter when food is scarce.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="animal-adaptation">
        <h4>Aquatic Animals</h4>
        <p>Fish have gills to extract oxygen from water. Some aquatic animals, like barnacles, attach permanently to surfaces. Others, like dolphins, need to swim to the surface to breathe air.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Biodiversity</h2>
    
    <div class="ecosystem-card">
        <h3>Endemic Species</h3>
        <p>Endemic species are found ONLY in a particular ecosystem and nowhere else on Earth. For example, the kangaroo is endemic to Australia, and the black-footed ferret is native to the North American prairies.</p>
        
        <div class="fun-fact">
            <p><strong>WOW Fact:</strong> The black-footed ferret was once thought to be extinct! Thanks to conservation efforts, these endangered animals are making a comeback in protected prairie ecosystems.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="ecosystem-card">
        <h3>Biodiversity Hotspots</h3>
        <p>Some ecosystems have an incredibly high number of different species. Tropical rainforests, coral reefs, and certain islands are known as biodiversity hotspots.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Geographic Locations</h2>
    
    <div class="ecosystem-card">
        <h3>Global Distribution</h3>
        <p>Ecosystems aren't randomly distributed around the planet. They follow patterns based on latitude, climate, and geography:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tundra ecosystems are found in the far north and on high mountains</li>
            <li>Deserts are often found around 30¬∞ north and south of the equator</li>
            <li>Rainforests are primarily located near the equator</li>
            <li>Temperate forests exist in mid-latitude regions with moderate climates</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="ecosystem-card">
        <h3>Elevational Effects</h3>
        <p>As you climb a tall mountain, you'll pass through different ecosystems. The ecosystems change with elevation similar to how they change with latitude as you move from the equator toward the poles!</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Human Interaction with Ecosystems</h2>
    
    <div class="ecosystem-card">
        <h3>Research Stations</h3>
        <p>Scientists study ecosystems from research stations in places like Antarctica, the Amazon Rainforest, and coral reefs to learn more about how these amazing systems work.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="ecosystem-card">
        <h3>National Preserves and Protected Areas</h3>
        <p>Many important ecosystems are protected in national parks, wildlife refuges, and marine sanctuaries to conserve their plants, animals, and natural processes.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="ecosystem-card">
        <h3>Historical Significance</h3>
        <p>Some ecosystems have played important roles in human history. For example, the prairies of North America were home to huge bison herds that were central to the cultures of many Native American tribes.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Formation of Ecosystems</h2>
    
    <div class="ecosystem-card">
        <h3>Geological Origins</h3>
        <p>Many ecosystems were shaped by geological events:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Volcanic eruptions create new land that eventually develops into ecosystems</li>
            <li>Glaciers carved out lakes and valleys during ice ages</li>
            <li>Mountains form when tectonic plates collide, creating new habitats at different elevations</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="ecosystem-card">
        <h3>Ecosystem Age and Development</h3>
        <p>Some ecosystems are very ancient, like certain rainforests that have existed for millions of years. Others are relatively young, like newly formed volcanic islands.</p>
        
        <div class="fun-fact">
            <p><strong>WOW Fact:</strong> After a volcanic eruption creates new land, the first organisms to arrive are often lichens (a partnership between fungi and algae). These tough pioneers help break down rock into soil, eventually allowing other plants to grow!</p>
        </div>
