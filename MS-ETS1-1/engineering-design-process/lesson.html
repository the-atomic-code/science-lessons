    <h1>The Engineering Design Process</h1>
    <div class="highlight-box">
    <p>Welcome to our lesson on the Engineering Design Process! In this lesson, you'll learn how engineers approach and solve problems in a structured, yet creative way. By the end, you'll understand the phases of the engineering design process and how engineers use criteria and constraints to develop successful solutions to real-world problems.</p>

</div>

<h2>What is Engineering?</h2>
<p>Before diving into the engineering design process, let's define what engineering actually is:</p>
<div class="key-terms">
    <p><span class="key-term">Engineering:</span> The use of scientific, mathematic, and design principles to solve problems.</p>
</div>
<p>Engineers work in many different fields to solve a wide variety of problems. They might develop solutions to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Reduce pollution</li>
    <li>Create medical devices for surgeries</li>
    <li>Design faster and more fuel-efficient vehicles</li>
    <li>Develop renewable energy systems</li>
    <li>Create recycling systems for plastic waste</li>
    <li>Build bridges, buildings, and other structures</li>
</ul>

<div class="image-container">
    <img src="drone_internal_components.jpg" alt="Drone Internal Components">
    <p class="image-caption">Engineering combines multiple disciplines - like this drone that requires mechanical, electrical, and software engineering</p>
</div>

<h2>The Engineering Design Process: An Overview</h2>
<p>The engineering design process is a series of steps that engineers follow to guide them in solving problems. While there are many versions of this process (ranging from 6 to 19 steps!), they all share three main phases:</p>

<div class="image-container">
    <img src="3_phase_engineering_design_process.jpg" alt="Three Phase Engineering Design Process">
    <p class="image-caption">The three main phases of the engineering design process</p>
</div>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Define the problem</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Develop ideas</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Optimize the design solution</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>An important characteristic of the engineering design process is that it's <span class="key-term">iterative</span>. This means that engineers don't simply move through the steps in a straight line. Instead, they often repeat steps, jump back and forth between phases, and cycle through the process multiple times to improve their solutions.</p>

<div class="image-container">
    <img src="engineering_design_process_flowchart.jpg" alt="Engineering Design Process Flowchart">
    <p class="image-caption">A flowchart showing how the engineering design process cycles through different steps</p>
</div>

<div class="checkpoint">
    <h3>Quick Check!</h3>
    <p>What does it mean when we say the engineering design process is "iterative"?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It means engineers repeat steps and don't necessarily follow a linear order</li>
        <li>It means engineers only test their designs at the end</li>
        <li>It means engineers go through the process only once</li>
        <li>It means engineers work individually rather than in teams</li>
    </ul>
    <p>(The correct answer is the first one!)</p>
</div>

<h2>Phase 1: Define the Problem</h2>
<p>In the first phase, engineers clearly identify what problem needs to be solved. This might involve:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Being assigned a specific problem to work on</li>
    <li>Observing the world around them to identify needs</li>
    <li>Talking with potential users to understand their challenges</li>
</ul>

<div class="image-container">
    <img src="defining_the_problem.jpg" alt="Engineers Defining a Problem">
    <p class="image-caption">Engineers discussing and defining a problem before beginning to design solutions</p>
</div>

<p>Two critical components of problem definition are understanding the criteria and constraints:</p>

<div class="key-terms">
    <p><span class="key-term">Design criteria:</span> The requirements needed to be met in order for the design idea to be considered a success.</p>
    <p><span class="key-term">Design constraints:</span> The limitations that are placed on the design idea, such as cost, materials, time, or other restrictions.</p>
</div>

<div class="example">
    <h3>Example: Water Filtration System</h3>
    <p>Imagine engineers designing a water filtration system for a rural community:</p>
    <p><strong>Criteria (requirements for success):</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Must remove 99% of harmful bacteria</li>
        <li>Must filter at least 100 gallons per day</li>
        <li>Must be easy to use without special training</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Constraints (limitations):</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Must cost less than $200 to build</li>
        <li>Must use locally available materials</li>
        <li>Must operate without electricity</li>
        <li>Must be completed within 6 months</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="activity">
    <h3>Try It Yourself: Identifying Criteria and Constraints</h3>
    <p>Think about designing a solar-powered device to charge phones in areas without electricity. What might be some criteria and constraints?</p>
    <p>Criteria might include: charges phones fully in less than 4 hours, works in partial sunlight, charges multiple devices simultaneously.</p>
    <p>Constraints might include: must cost less than $50, must weigh less than 2 pounds, must be waterproof, must use available materials.</p>
</div>

<h2>Phase 2: Develop Ideas</h2>
<p>Once the problem is clearly defined, engineers begin developing possible solutions. This phase includes several activities:</p>

<div class="image-container">
    <img src="brainstorming_researching_developing_solutions.jpg" alt="Engineers Brainstorming and Developing Solutions">
    <p class="image-caption">Engineers brainstorming and researching to develop potential solutions</p>
</div>

<h3>Brainstorming</h3>
<div class="key-terms">
    <p><span class="key-term">Brainstorming:</span> An informal, creative process used to generate ideas without judgment.</p>
</div>
<p>During brainstorming, engineers:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Work individually or in groups</li>
    <li>Sketch and label diagrams</li>
    <li>Take notes about potential solutions</li>
    <li>Document all ideas without evaluating them (no idea is a "bad" idea during brainstorming!)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Research</h3>
<div class="key-terms">
    <p><span class="key-term">Research:</span> The gathering of information about ideas related to an engineering solution.</p>
</div>
<p>Research activities might include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Using online or print resources</li>
    <li>Testing materials</li>
    <li>Interviewing experts or potential users</li>
    <li>Investigating existing solutions to similar problems</li>
</ul>
<p>Engineers often move back and forth between brainstorming and research, using new information to inspire more ideas.</p>

<h3>Developing Solution Models</h3>
<p>After brainstorming and research, engineers develop more detailed models of potential solutions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Drawing detailed sketches with labels</li>
    <li>Creating flowcharts showing inputs, outputs, and energy flow</li>
    <li>Developing Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models</li>
</ul>

<div class="image-container">
    <img src="engineer_working_on_CAD_model.jpg" alt="Engineer Working on CAD Model">
    <p class="image-caption">An engineer developing a detailed Computer-Aided Design (CAD) model</p>
</div>

<div class="key-terms">
    <p><span class="key-term">Computer-Aided Design (CAD):</span> Software used to create precise 3D models showing how parts of a system move and interact.</p>
</div>

<div class="checkpoint">
    <h3>Quick Check!</h3>
    <p>What is the primary purpose of brainstorming in engineering design?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To generate many ideas without judging them</li>
        <li>To select the final design solution</li>
        <li>To test prototypes</li>
        <li>To document final results</li>
    </ul>
    <p>(The correct answer is the first one!)</p>
</div>

<h2>Phase 3: Optimize the Design Solution</h2>
<p>In the final phase, engineers build, test, and improve their design solutions.</p>

<div class="image-container">
    <img src="optimize_the_design_solution.jpg" alt="Engineers Optimizing Design Solution">
    <p class="image-caption">Engineers testing and refining a prototype during the optimization phase</p>
</div>

<h3>Prototyping</h3>
<div class="key-terms">
    <p><span class="key-term">Prototype:</span> A first, or preliminary, model built to demonstrate and test the functionality of a design solution.</p>
</div>
<p>Prototypes allow engineers to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Test if the design works as intended</li>
    <li>Identify problems or weaknesses</li>
    <li>Collect data on performance</li>
    <li>Show the design to potential users for feedback</li>
</ul>

<h3>Testing and Optimizing</h3>
<div class="key-terms">
    <p><span class="key-term">Optimizing design solutions:</span> The continual process of testing and improving a design solution.</p>
</div>
<p>During optimization, engineers:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Perform tests to see how well the design meets the criteria</li>
    <li>Collect and analyze data</li>
    <li>Identify ways to improve the design</li>
    <li>Make changes and test again</li>
    <li>Repeat until the design successfully meets all criteria within the constraints</li>
</ul>

<div class="example">
    <h3>Example: Electric Vehicle Design</h3>
    <p>Engineers designing an electric vehicle might optimize their design by:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Building a prototype and testing its range on a single charge</li>
        <li>Analyzing data and discovering the battery loses efficiency in cold temperatures</li>
        <li>Redesigning the battery insulation system</li>
        <li>Testing the new design in different temperature conditions</li>
        <li>Further refining the design based on new test results</li>
        <li>Continuing this cycle until the vehicle meets all criteria (range, speed, safety) within constraints (cost, weight, manufacturing capabilities)</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<div class="reflection">
    <h3>Think About It</h3>
    <p>Why is optimization so important in engineering design? Consider what might happen if engineers simply built their first design idea without going through multiple testing and improvement cycles.</p>
</div>

<h2>Using Criteria and Constraints Throughout the Process</h2>
<p>Criteria and constraints play a crucial role throughout the entire engineering design process:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>During problem definition:</strong> They help clarify exactly what the solution needs to accomplish and within what limitations.</li>
    <li><strong>During idea development:</strong> They guide brainstorming and help engineers focus on feasible solutions.</li>
    <li><strong>During optimization:</strong> They provide the standards against which designs are tested and evaluated.</li>
    <li><strong>When comparing competing designs:</strong> They help engineers decide which solution is best.</li>
</ul>

<div class="activity">
    <h3>Scenario Analysis: Bridge Design</h3>
    <p>A community needs a new bridge across a river. Consider these factors and determine which are criteria and which are constraints:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Must support vehicles up to 40 tons (Criterion)</li>
        <li>Budget of $2 million (Constraint)</li>
        <li>Must be completed within 18 months (Constraint)</li>
        <li>Must withstand flooding (Criterion)</li>
        <li>Cannot disturb protected wildlife habitat (Constraint)</li>
        <li>Must include pedestrian walkway (Criterion)</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h2>Real-World Applications of the Engineering Design Process</h2>
<p>The engineering design process is used in countless fields to solve a wide variety of problems:</p>

    <li>Design water management infrastructure</li>
</ul>

<div class="example">
    <h3>Case Study: Waste Management Solution</h3>
    <p>Engineers designing a new waste management system for a city would need to consider multiple stakeholder perspectives:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Environmental:</strong> Minimize pollution and ecological impact</li>
        <li><strong>Economic:</strong> Keep costs affordable for the city and residents</li>
        <li><strong>Social:</strong> Ensure the system is convenient and acceptable to residents</li>
        <li><strong>Technical:</strong> Ensure the system can handle the volume and types of waste generated</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Success criteria would need to balance all these perspectives, while constraints might include available land, budget limitations, and existing infrastructure.</p>
</div>
