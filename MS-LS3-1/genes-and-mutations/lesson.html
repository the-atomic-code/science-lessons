                <p>Within each chromosome, there are thousands of smaller sections called genes. These are the specific instructions that determine your individual traits!</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>Genes are:</strong>
                    <ul>

                <h3>How Do Genes Work?</h3>
                <p>Genes don't directly create traits. Instead, they provide instructions for making proteins, which then create the traits we see. It's like a three-step process:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Gene (DNA)</strong> → Contains the instruction</li>
                    <li><strong>Protein</strong> → Carries out the instruction</li>
                    <li><strong>Trait</strong> → The visible or functional result</li>
                </ol>

                <div class="fun-fact">
                    🎨 Fun Fact: Humans have approximately 20,000-25,000 genes, but we share about 99.9% of our DNA with each other. It's that tiny 0.1% difference that makes you unique!
                </div>

                <h3>Trait Variation</h3>
                <p>Even within the same family, siblings don't look exactly alike (unless they're identical twins). This happens because of <strong>variation of traits</strong> - the differences that occur in the same trait within a population. These variations happen randomly when DNA is passed from parent to offspring.</p>

                <p>Proteins are the incredible molecules that actually do the work in your body. They're like tiny, specialized workers, each with a specific job to do!</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>Proteins are:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Made from chains of building blocks called amino acids</li>
                        <li>Often called the "building blocks of life"</li>
                        <li>Shaped in very specific ways (structure)</li>

                <h3>Structure Determines Function</h3>
                <p>This is one of the most important concepts in biology! The shape of a protein determines what job it can do. It's like how the shape of a key determines which lock it can open.</p>

                        This diagram illustrates how mutations in DNA can lead to changes in protein structure and function. When the genetic code changes, it can alter the amino acid sequence, which in turn changes the protein's shape and ability to perform its job correctly.

                    <h3>📝 Typo Analogy:</h3>
                    <p>Think of mutations like typos in a recipe. Sometimes a typo doesn't matter ("add 1 cup flour" vs "add 1 cupp flour"), sometimes it makes the recipe better, and sometimes it ruins the whole dish ("add 1 cup salt" instead of "add 1 teaspoon salt")!</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Types of Mutation Effects</h3>
                <div class="key-terms">

                <h2>🔄 How Mutations Are Passed On</h2>
                
                <h3>Inherited vs. Acquired Mutations</h3>
                <div class="key-terms">
                    <div class="term-card">
                        <div class="term-title">🧬 Inherited Mutations</div>
                        <p>These are mutations present in reproductive cells (sperm and egg) that can be passed from parents to offspring. They affect every cell in the offspring's body. The hairless trait in Sphynx cats is an example of an inherited mutation.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="term-card">
                        <div class="term-title">⚡ Acquired Mutations</div>
                        <p>These occur during an organism's lifetime in specific cells (like skin cells from sun exposure). They are NOT passed to offspring unless they occur in reproductive cells.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>Mutations During DNA Replication</h3>
                <p>Every time a cell divides, it must copy all of its DNA. During this copying process:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Random errors can occur (like typos when copying a document)</li>
                    <li>Most errors are caught and fixed by cellular "proofreading" systems</li>
                    <li>Some errors slip through, creating mutations</li>
                    <li>These mutations contribute to genetic variation in populations</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="interactive-element">
                    <h3>🎯 Mutation Impact Factors</h3>
                    <p><strong>Where the mutation occurs in the gene sequence matters!</strong></p>
                    <p>• Beginning of gene = Bigger impact on protein</p>
                    <p>• Middle of gene = Moderate impact</p>
                    <p>• End of gene = Smaller impact</p>
                    <p>• Non-coding regions = Often no impact</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>Blood System Example:</strong>
                    <p>Mutations in genes that code for hemoglobin (the oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells) can affect how well blood carries oxygen throughout the body. Some mutations cause sickle cell anemia, while others might provide resistance to malaria.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>Immune System Example:</strong>
                    <p>Mutations affecting immune system proteins can change how well an organism fights off diseases. Some mutations might make someone more resistant to certain infections, while others might make them more susceptible.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>Muscle System Example:</strong>

                    🌟 Remember: Every living thing on Earth - from the tiniest bacteria to the largest whale - uses this same basic system of DNA, genes, proteins, and mutations. You're part of an amazing, interconnected web of life! The examples you've seen - from the hairless Sphynx cat to the white peacock - show how this system creates the incredible diversity of life around us.
