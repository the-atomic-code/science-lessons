<h1>üß™ The Amazing World of Solutions: A Q&A Adventure! üîç</h1>

<div class="question">
    Q1: What is a solution?
    <br>
    <button id="btn_a1" onclick="toggleAnswer('a1')">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="a1">
        A solution is a specific type of homogeneous mixture where one substance (solute) is dissolved into another substance (solvent). Key characteristics:<br><br>
        ‚Ä¢ Uniform throughout<br>
        ‚Ä¢ Doesn't change over time<br>
        ‚Ä¢ Doesn't settle<br>
        ‚Ä¢ Doesn't scatter light<br>
        ‚Ä¢ Particles are too small to be filtered
    </div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    Q2: What's the difference between a solute and a solvent?
    <br>
    <button id="btn_a2" onclick="toggleAnswer('a2')">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="a2">
        ‚Ä¢ Solute: The substance being dissolved (like salt in saltwater)<br>
        ‚Ä¢ Solvent: The substance that does the dissolving (like water in saltwater)
    </div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    Q3: What happens during the dissolving process?
    <br>
    <button id="btn_a3" onclick="toggleAnswer('a3')">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="a3">
        During dissolving:<br><br>
        ‚Ä¢ The solute breaks up from larger crystals into smaller particles<br>
        ‚Ä¢ These particles can be molecules or individual ions<br>
        ‚Ä¢ In salt water, water molecules actively break salt molecules away from their crystal lattice<br>
        ‚Ä¢ The particles become evenly distributed throughout the solvent
    </div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    Q4: What is solubility and what happens in a saturated solution?
    <br>
    <button id="btn_a4" onclick="toggleAnswer('a4')">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="a4">
        ‚Ä¢ Solubility is the measurement of how much solute can be dissolved in a liter of solvent<br>
        ‚Ä¢ A solution becomes saturated when it cannot dissolve any more solute<br>
        ‚Ä¢ Any additional solute added to a saturated solution will not dissolve<br>
        ‚Ä¢ The undissolved solute will collect at the bottom of the container
    </div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    Q5: How do we describe the concentration of solutions?
    <br>
    <button id="btn_a5" onclick="toggleAnswer('a5')">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="a5">
        Concentration refers to the proportion of solute to solvent:<br><br>
        ‚Ä¢ Concentrated solution: High amount of solute relative to solvent<br>
        ‚Ä¢ Diluted solution: Low amount of solute relative to solvent<br>
        ‚Ä¢ The more solute present, the more concentrated the solution
    </div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    Q6: What's the difference between miscible and immiscible liquids?
    <br>
    <button id="btn_a6" onclick="toggleAnswer('a6')">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="a6">
        ‚Ä¢ Miscible liquids: Can mix together to form a solution (example: water and ethanol)<br>
        ‚Ä¢ Immiscible liquids: Cannot mix to form a solution (example: oil and water)<br>
        ‚Ä¢ Miscible liquids form a uniform mixture<br>
        ‚Ä¢ Immiscible liquids form separate layers
    </div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    Q7: What makes a mixture a solution? How is it different from other mixtures?
    <br>
    <button id="btn_a7" onclick="toggleAnswer('a7')">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="a7">
        A solution is special because:<br><br>
        ‚Ä¢ It is always homogeneous (uniform throughout)<br>
        ‚Ä¢ The particles are too small to be seen<br>
        ‚Ä¢ It doesn't separate over time<br>
        ‚Ä¢ It won't scatter light (clear, not cloudy)<br>
        ‚Ä¢ The solute and solvent are thoroughly mixed at the molecular level
    </div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    Q8: Why can't we separate a solution by filtering?
    <br>
    <button id="btn_a8" onclick="toggleAnswer('a8')">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="a8">
        ‚Ä¢ The solute particles in a solution are extremely small (molecular size)<br>
        ‚Ä¢ These particles are much smaller than the pores in a filter paper<br>
        ‚Ä¢ The particles pass right through any normal filter<br>
        ‚Ä¢ Special separation techniques like distillation are needed to separate solutions
    </div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    Q9: What happens when you mix water and ethanol?
    <br>
    <button id="btn_a9" onclick="toggleAnswer('a9')">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="a9">
        When water and ethanol mix:<br><br>
        ‚Ä¢ They form a clear, colorless solution<br>
        ‚Ä¢ They are completely miscible<br>
        ‚Ä¢ You can mix them in any proportion<br>
        ‚Ä¢ The resulting solution will always be uniform<br>
        ‚Ä¢ The mixture remains stable and doesn't separate
    </div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    Q10: How can you tell if a solution is homogeneous?
    <br>
    <button id="btn_a10" onclick="toggleAnswer('a10')">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="a10">
        A solution is homogeneous when:<br><br>
        ‚Ä¢ It looks the same throughout<br>
        ‚Ä¢ There are no visible particles<br>
        ‚Ä¢ It doesn't separate into layers<br>
        ‚Ä¢ The composition is uniform at any point<br>
        ‚Ä¢ Light passes through without scattering
    </div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    Q11: Why do oil and water not form a solution?
    <br>
    <button id="btn_a11" onclick="toggleAnswer('a11')">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="a11">
        Oil and water are immiscible because:<br><br>
        ‚Ä¢ They have different molecular properties<br>
        ‚Ä¢ They form separate layers instead of mixing<br>
        ‚Ä¢ No matter how much you stir them, they will eventually separate<br>
        ‚Ä¢ They cannot form a homogeneous mixture<br>
        ‚Ä¢ This is an example of immiscible liquids
    </div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    Q12: What are some characteristics that all solutions share?
    <br>
    <button id="btn_a12" onclick="toggleAnswer('a12')">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="a12">
        All solutions share these characteristics:<br><br>
        ‚Ä¢ They are homogeneous mixtures<br>
        ‚Ä¢ They contain a solute and a solvent<br>
        ‚Ä¢ The solute particles are evenly distributed<br>
        ‚Ä¢ They are stable and don't separate over time<br>
        ‚Ä¢ They are clear (don't scatter light)<br>
        ‚Ä¢ They cannot be separated by filtering
