<h1>üß™ Pure Substances vs Mixtures: The Ultimate Matter Challenge! üîç</h1>
<p>Test your knowledge about matter classification with these exciting questions!</p>
</div>

<div style="padding: 20px;">

<div class="question">
<h3>Q1: What are the two main categories of matter found on Earth? üåç</h3>
<button onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show Answer</button>
<div class="answer">Matter can be classified into pure substances and mixtures.</div>
</div>

<div class="question">
<h3>Q2: What qualifies as a pure substance? Choose all that apply:</h3>
<button onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show Answer</button>
<div class="answer">
A pure substance can be either:
<br>a) An element (found on the periodic table)
<br>b) A compound (elements chemically bonded together)
<br>
Example: Water (H‚ÇÇO) is a pure substance because it's a compound of hydrogen and oxygen chemically bonded together.</div>
</div>

<div class="question">
<h3>Q3: What's the key difference between a pure substance and a mixture? ü§î</h3>
<button onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show Answer</button>
<div class="answer">Pure substances cannot be separated physically and require chemical processes to break them down, while mixtures can be separated using physical methods.</div>
</div>

<div class="question">
<h3>Q4: What are the two types of mixtures? Give an example of each! üé®</h3>
<button onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show Answer</button>
<div class="answer">
1. Homogeneous mixtures (uniform throughout)
- Examples: Gatorade, gasoline, brass (copper + zinc)
<br><br>
2. Heterogeneous mixtures (not uniform throughout)
- Examples: Fruit salad, oil and vinegar, soil</div>
</div>

<div class="question">
<h3>Q5: Is salt water a homogeneous or heterogeneous mixture? Explain why! üåä</h3>
<button onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show Answer</button>
<div class="answer">Salt water is a homogeneous mixture because it's uniform throughout - you cannot see the individual salt particles once dissolved, and every sample taken from the solution would have the same composition.</div>
</div>

<div class="question">
<h3>Q6: Complete this statement: If a substance cannot be separated physically but can be separated by a chemical process, it is a _______. üß™</h3>
<button onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show Answer</button>
<div class="answer">Compound. For example, water (H‚ÇÇO) can only be separated into hydrogen and oxygen through electrolysis, which is a chemical process.</div>
</div>

<div class="question">
<h3>Q7: Which of these is NOT a pure substance? ü§ì
<br>a) Gold
<br>b) Carbon dioxide
<br>c) Air
<br>d) Water</h3>
<button onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show Answer</button>
<div class="answer">c) Air is NOT a pure substance - it's a homogeneous mixture of different gases including nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and other gases.</div>
</div>

<div class="question">
<h3>Q8: How would you classify brass? Explain your reasoning! üé≠</h3>
<button onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show Answer</button>
<div class="answer">Brass is a homogeneous mixture (specifically, an alloy) of copper and zinc. It's homogeneous because the metals are uniformly distributed throughout the material, but it's still a mixture because the metals aren't chemically bonded together.</div>
</div>

<div class="question">
<h3>Q9: Create a classification flowchart for pizza! üçï</h3>
<button onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show Answer</button>
<div class="answer">
1. Can it be separated physically? YES
<br>2. Is it uniform throughout? NO
<br>3. Therefore, pizza is a heterogeneous mixture because its components (cheese, sauce, toppings) are visibly different throughout and can be physically separated.</div>
</div>

<div class="question">
<h3>Q10: True or False: All solutions are mixtures, but not all mixtures are solutions. Explain! üí≠</h3>
<button onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show Answer</button>
<div class="answer">TRUE! Solutions are homogeneous mixtures where one substance is dissolved in another. While all solutions are mixtures, some mixtures (like heterogeneous mixtures) are not solutions because their composition isn't uniform throughout.</div>
</div>

<div class="question">
<h3>Q11: What's the difference between carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ) and a carbonated beverage? Classify each! ü•§</h3>
<button onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show Answer</button>
<div class="answer">Carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ) is a pure substance (compound) because it consists of carbon and oxygen chemically bonded together. A carbonated beverage is a homogeneous mixture because it contains CO‚ÇÇ dissolved in water along with other ingredients, and these components can be physically separated.</div>
</div>

<div class="question">
<h3>Q12: Using the flowchart from the video, classify soil. Show your work! üå±</h3>
<button onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show Answer</button>
<div class="answer">
1. Can it be separated physically? YES (soil components can be separated by filtering, sifting, etc.)
<br>2. Is it uniform throughout? NO (soil contains visible different components like rocks, organic matter, minerals)
<br>3. Therefore, soil is a heterogeneous mixture</div>
</div>

<div class="question">
<h3>Q13: Why is water (H‚ÇÇO) considered a pure substance while ocean water is not? üíß</h3>
<button onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show Answer</button>
<div class="answer">Water (H‚ÇÇO) is a pure substance because it's a compound made of hydrogen and oxygen atoms chemically bonded together in a fixed ratio. Ocean water is a homogeneous mixture because it contains dissolved salts and minerals that can be physically separated from the water through processes like evaporation.</div>
</div>

<div class="question">
<h3>Q14: What type of separation method would you use for these mixtures? üîç
<br>a) Oil and water
<br>b) Salt water
<br>c) Iron filings and sand</h3>
<button onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show Answer</button>
<div class="answer">
a) Oil and water: Physical separation using a separating funnel (based on density differences)
<br>b) Salt water: Evaporation or distillation (physical separation)
<br>c) Iron filings and sand: Magnetic separation (physical separation)
<br>Note: All these are mixtures because they can be separated using physical methods.</div>
</div>

<div class="question">
<h3>Q15: Explain why gasoline is classified as a homogeneous mixture rather than a pure substance. ‚õΩ</h3>
<button onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show Answer</button>
<div class="answer">Gasoline is a homogeneous mixture because:
<br>1. It contains different hydrocarbons and additives mixed together
<br>2. These components can be separated through physical processes like distillation
<br>3. The mixture is uniform throughout (you can't see the different components)
<br>4. Any sample taken from the mixture would have the same properties</div>
</div>
