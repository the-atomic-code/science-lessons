    <h2>Introduction to Changes in Matter</h2>
    <p>Everything in our world is made of matter, and matter is constantly changing. Some changes are simple and temporary, while others create entirely new substances. Understanding these changes helps us make sense of the world around us.</p>
    
    <div class="info-box">
        <h3>Two Types of Changes in Matter:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chemical Changes:</strong> A new substance is formed.</li>
            <li><strong>Physical Changes:</strong> No new substance is formed.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <p class="image-caption">Various examples of chemical and physical changes we encounter in daily life</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Chemical Changes</h2>
    <p>In a chemical change, a new substance is formed with different properties than the original materials. This happens when the atoms in the original substances rearrange to form new molecules and compounds.</p>
    
    <div class="info-box">
        <h3>Key Characteristics of Chemical Changes:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A new substance with new properties is formed</li>
            <li>The change is usually difficult to reverse</li>
            <li>Often involves combining two or more materials</li>
            <li>May produce amazing reactions like explosions or color changes</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="burning_paper_reaction_products.jpg" alt="Burning paper showing chemical change">
        <p class="image-caption">When paper burns, it undergoes a chemical change, forming new substances like carbon dioxide and water vapor</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Chemical changes often show certain signs that can help us identify them:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Formation of bubbles (gas production)</li>
        <li>Change in color</li>
        <li>Change in temperature (heating up or cooling down)</li>
        <li>Production of light or sound</li>
        <li>Formation of a precipitate (solid forming in a liquid)</li>
    </ul>

        <p class="image-caption">A colorful chemical reaction showing dramatic color changes - a common indicator of chemical change</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>However, these signs alone don't guarantee a chemical change. The most reliable way to determine if a chemical change occurred is to ask: <span class="highlight">Was the substance formed present before the reaction?</span> If the answer is no, then it's a chemical change.</p>
    
    <div class="example-box">
        <h3>Examples of Chemical Changes:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Burning:</strong> When something burns, it combines with oxygen in the air to form new substances. For example, when a candle burns, the wax combines with oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water vapor - completely new substances!</li>
            <li><strong>Rusting:</strong> When iron rusts, it combines with oxygen to form iron oxide (rust), which is a new substance with different properties.</li>
            <li><strong>Cooking an egg:</strong> The heat changes the proteins in the egg, creating new substances that can't be changed back to raw egg.</li>
            <li><strong>Digestion:</strong> When you eat food, your body breaks it down through chemical changes to extract nutrients.</li>
        </ul>

        </div>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Physical Changes</h2>
    <p>In a physical change, the appearance or form of matter changes, but its chemical composition remains the same. No new substances are created during a physical change.</p>
    
    <div class="info-box">
        <h3>Key Characteristics of Physical Changes:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>No new substance is formed</li>
            <li>The change is usually easy to reverse</li>
            <li>The chemical composition stays the same</li>
            <li>May involve changes in shape, size, or state of matter</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <p>Physical changes include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Changes in shape (cutting, tearing, crumpling)</li>
        <li>Changes in size (breaking, crushing)</li>
        <li>Changes in state (melting, freezing, boiling, condensing)</li>
        <li>Dissolving substances (like sugar in water)</li>
        <li>Mixing substances without chemical reaction</li>

    <div class="example-box">
        <h3>Examples of Physical Changes:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cutting a banana:</strong> The banana pieces are still banana - just in smaller pieces.</li>
            <li><strong>Ice melting:</strong> Solid water (ice) changes to liquid water, but it's still H₂O.</li>
            <li><strong>Dissolving salt in water:</strong> The salt can be recovered by evaporating the water.</li>
            <li><strong>Mixing cereal and milk:</strong> Both substances remain chemically unchanged.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Phase Changes: A Special Type of Physical Change</h2>
    <p>When matter changes from one state to another (solid, liquid, gas), it undergoes a physical change called a phase change. The chemical composition remains the same, but the arrangement of molecules changes.</p>
    
    <div class="info-box">
        <h3>Common Phase Changes:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Melting:</strong> Solid → Liquid (ice → water)</li>
            <li><strong>Freezing:</strong> Liquid → Solid (water → ice)</li>
            <li><strong>Vaporization (Boiling/Evaporation):</strong> Liquid → Gas (water → water vapor)</li>
            <li><strong>Condensation:</strong> Gas → Liquid (water vapor → water)</li>
            <li><strong>Sublimation:</strong> Solid → Gas (dry ice → carbon dioxide gas)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <p class="image-caption">A melting popsicle demonstrates a phase change (solid to liquid) - a physical change where no new substances form</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="example-box">
        <h3>Example: Gallium Spoon Experiment</h3>
        <p>Gallium is a metal with a very low melting point (about 30°C/86°F). When a gallium spoon is placed in hot water, it melts! This is a physical change because the gallium is still gallium - it has just changed from a solid to a liquid state. When the liquid gallium cools, it can solidify back into a solid shape.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Reversibility of Changes</h2>
    <p>One important difference between physical and chemical changes is how easily they can be reversed.</p>
    
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Physical Changes</th>
            <th>Chemical Changes</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Usually easy to reverse</td>
            <td>Usually difficult or impossible to reverse</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Example: Ice melting to water can be reversed by freezing the water</td>
            <td>Example: A burned piece of wood cannot easily be turned back into the original wood</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    
    <p>However, reversibility alone doesn't always determine the type of change. Some physical changes can be difficult to reverse (like cutting paper), and some chemical changes can be reversed through other chemical reactions.</p>
    
    <h2>Surprising Examples and Common Misconceptions</h2>
    
    <div class="example-box">
        <h3>The Mentos and Soda Reaction</h3>
        <p>When Mentos candy is dropped into carbonated soda, it creates an impressive fountain of foam. This looks like a chemical reaction, but it's actually a physical change! The carbon dioxide gas was already dissolved in the soda, and the Mentos provides nucleation sites that allow the gas to escape rapidly. No new substances are formed in this process.</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="coke_and_mentos.jpg" alt="Coke and Mentos reaction">
            <p class="image-caption">The Coke and Mentos reaction looks dramatic but is actually a physical change as no new substances form</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="activity-box">
        <h3>Think About It:</h3>
        <p>Why does carbon dioxide gas make candles go out? Carbon dioxide is heavier than air and displaces oxygen as it flows downward. Without oxygen, the flame cannot continue to burn, so it goes out. This property makes carbon dioxide useful in fire extinguishers.</p>

    <div class="info-box">
        <h3>Flame Test for Gases</h3>
        <p>A flame test is a scientific method to identify different types of gases based on how they react when exposed to a flame:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Oxygen:</strong> Makes the flame burn brighter</li>
            <li><strong>Carbon dioxide:</strong> Extinguishes the flame</li>
            <li><strong>Hydrogen:</strong> Produces a "pop" sound when ignited (highly flammable)</li>

            <li>Form new substances</li>
            <li>Often irreversible</li>
            <li>May show signs like color change, gas production, temperature change</li>
            <li>Examples: burning, rusting, cooking food, digestion</li>

        <h3>Physical Changes:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>No new substances formed</li>
            <li>Usually reversible</li>
            <li>Include changes in shape, size, or state</li>
            <li>Examples: cutting, melting, freezing, dissolving</li>
