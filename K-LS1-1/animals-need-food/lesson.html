    <h1>How Animals Need Food to Survive</h1>
    
    <div class="section">
      <h2>What Do Animals Need?</h2>
      <p>All animals need food and water to survive. Without food, animals cannot live and grow. Different animals eat different kinds of foods. Some animals eat plants, some eat other animals, and some eat both! Animals get their food from their environment.</p>
      
      <div class="fun-fact">
        <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Just like you feel hungry when you need to eat, animals feel hunger too! Hunger is a feeling you get when your body needs food.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Animals That Eat Plants</h2>
      <p>Some animals only eat plants or things that grow on plants. These animals are called herbivores.</p>
      
      <div class="image-container">
        <img src="porcupine_eating.jpg" alt="Porcupine eating">
        <p class="image-caption">A porcupine eating fruit</p>
      </div>
      
      <p><strong>Porcupines</strong> are herbivores. They eat:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Leaves from trees and bushes</li>
        <li>Bark from tree trunks</li>
        <li>Berries that grow on plants</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Porcupines have special features that help them get their food:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sharp claws that help them climb trees to reach leaves and bark</li>
        <li>Strong, sharp teeth to strip bark from trees</li>
      </ul>
      
      <div class="image-container">
        <img src="porcupine_sharp_claws_sharp_teeth.jpg" alt="Porcupine's sharp claws and teeth">
        <p class="image-caption">A porcupine using its sharp claws to climb and access food</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="activity">
        <p><strong>Let's Think:</strong> If a porcupine didn't have sharp claws, how would this affect its ability to find food?</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Animals That Eat Other Animals</h2>
      <p>Some animals eat other animals to survive. These animals are called carnivores.</p>
      
      <div class="image-container">
        <img src="wolf_meat_eating.jpg" alt="Wolf eating meat">
        <p class="image-caption">A wolf carrying its prey</p>
      </div>
      
      <p><strong>Wolves</strong> are carnivores. They eat:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rabbits</li>
        <li>Deer</li>
        <li>Sometimes sheep</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Wolves have special ways to help them catch their food:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>They hunt in groups called packs, which makes catching prey easier</li>
        <li>They have excellent senses of smell and sight to find prey</li>
        <li>They have sharp teeth for tearing meat</li>
      </ul>
      
      <div class="fun-fact">
        <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> When wolves hunt together, they can catch animals much larger than themselves!</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
      <h2>How Animals Use Their Senses to Find Food</h2>
      <p>Animals use their senses like smell, sight, hearing, taste, and touch to help them find food.</p>
      
      <div class="image-container">
        <img src="savannah_monitor.jpg" alt="Savannah monitor">
        <p class="image-caption">A Savannah monitor using its tongue to smell for food</p>
      </div>
      
      <p><strong>The Savannah Monitor</strong> is a special type of lizard that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Uses its tongue to smell for food</li>
        <li>Can figure out which direction food is located by using its tongue</li>
        <li>Eats insects to survive</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>Frogs</strong> mainly eat bugs too, but they use:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Their excellent eyesight to spot moving insects</li>
        <li>A sticky tongue that shoots out quickly to catch bugs</li>
      </ul>
      
      <div class="activity">
        <p><strong>Try This:</strong> Close your eyes and try to identify a food just by smelling it. This is similar to how some animals find their food!</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Special Tools and Techniques</h2>
      <p>Some animals have special ways to get their food.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Monkeys</strong> are clever animals that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bang nuts on hard surfaces to crack them open</li>
        <li>Use their hands to pull apart nuts after cracking them</li>
        <li>Sometimes use tools like stones to smash nuts open</li>
      </ul>
      
      <div class="fun-fact">
        <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Using tools to get food is a sign of intelligence in animals. Humans use tools tooâ€”like forks and spoons!</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Predators and Prey</h2>
      <p>In nature, there is a special relationship between animals that hunt and animals that get hunted.</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Predators</strong> are animals that hunt other animals for food (like wolves)</li>
        <li><strong>Prey</strong> are animals that get hunted by other animals (like rabbits)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>This relationship is important in nature and helps keep animal populations balanced.</p>
      
      <div class="check-understanding">
        <p><strong>Think About It:</strong> If a wolf is a predator, what animals would be its prey?</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
      <h2>People Need Food Too!</h2>
      <p>Just like animals, people need food to live and grow. Most people eat food three times a day:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Breakfast in the morning</li>
        <li>Lunch in the middle of the day</li>
        <li>Dinner in the evening</li>
      </ul>
      
      <div class="image-container">
        <img src="pizza.jpg" alt="Pizza">
        <p class="image-caption">People eat many different foods like pizza</p>
      </div>
      
      <p>People eat many different things like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fruits and vegetables that come from plants</li>
        <li>Nuts and seeds from plants</li>
        <li>Meat that comes from animals</li>
        <li>Foods made from both plants and animals</li>
      </ul>
      
      <div class="activity">
        <p><strong>Think About:</strong> What did you eat today? Did it come from plants, animals, or both?</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="vocabulary">
