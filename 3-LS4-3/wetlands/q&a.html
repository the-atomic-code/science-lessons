<h1>ðŸŒ¿ Exploring the Wonderful World of Wetlands! ðŸ¦†</h1>

<div class="intro">
    Ready to dive into the fascinating world of wetlands? Let's discover these amazing ecosystems that are neither fully land nor fully water, but something wonderfully in between! ðŸŒ¾ðŸ’§
</div>

<div class="question">
    <p><strong>Q1: What exactly are wetlands, and what makes them unique ecosystems?</strong></p>
    <button class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer">
        Wetlands are special aquatic ecosystems that serve as transition zones between land and water bodies (such as lakes or ponds). They are unique because:<br>
        - They combine characteristics of both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems<br>
        - They are literally "wet lands" - areas where water meets land<br>
        - They create distinct environments that support specialized plant and animal life
        <div class="fun-fact">ðŸŒŸ Fun Fact: Wetlands are often called "nature's kidneys" because they filter and clean water naturally!</div>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <p><strong>Q2: Can you explain each type of wetland in detail?</strong></p>
    <button class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer">
        Here are the four main types of wetlands:<br><br>
        1. Marshes:<br>
        - No trees present<br>
        - Abundant grass vegetation<br>
        - Located at edges of lakes and streams<br>
        - Form transition zones between aquatic and land ecosystems<br><br>
        
        2. Swamps:<br>
        - Dominated by trees<br>
        - Water-saturated soil<br>
        - Rich woody vegetation<br><br>
        
        3. Fens:<br>
        - Dominated by grasses<br>
        - Mineral-rich water supply<br><br>
        
        4. Bogs:<br>
        - Accumulate peat (dead plant material)<br>
        - Often contain mosses<br>
        - Typically acidic environments
    </div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <p><strong>Q3: What makes wetlands such productive ecosystems?</strong></p>
    <button class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer">
        Wetlands are highly productive because they:<br>
        - Support incredible biodiversity<br>
        - Host diverse plant species<br>
        - Provide habitat for numerous animals including:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;â€¢ Insects<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;â€¢ Amphibians<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;â€¢ Reptiles<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;â€¢ Birds<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;â€¢ Fish<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;â€¢ Mammals<br>
        - Are nutrient-dense environments<br>
        - Play vital roles in water and nitrogen cycles
        <div class="fun-fact">ðŸŒŸ Fun Fact: A single wetland can support thousands of different species!</div>
    </div>

<div class="question">
    <p><strong>Q4: How do marshes differ from other types of wetlands?</strong></p>
    <button class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer">
        Marshes have distinct characteristics:<br>
        - They are treeless wetlands<br>
        - Dominated by grass-like plants<br>
        - Often found at the edges of lakes and streams<br>
        - Serve as important transition zones<br>
        - Support unique wildlife adapted to this environment
    </div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <p><strong>Q5: What is peat, and why is it significant in wetland ecosystems?</strong></p>
    <button class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer">
        Peat is:<br>
        - A deposit of dead plant material<br>
        - Primarily found in bogs<br>
        - Accumulates over time<br>
        - Creates unique habitat conditions<br>
        - Often associated with moss growth
        <div class="fun-fact">ðŸŒŸ Fun Fact: Peat bogs are excellent carbon sinks, helping to combat climate change!</div>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <p><strong>Q6: How do wetlands contribute to environmental cycles?</strong></p>
    <button class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer">
        Wetlands contribute to important environmental cycles by:<br>
        - Participating in the water cycle through:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;â€¢ Water storage<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;â€¢ Water filtration<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;â€¢ Water release<br>
        - Contributing to the nitrogen cycle through:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;â€¢ Nutrient processing<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;â€¢ Nutrient storage<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;â€¢ Nutrient release

<div class="question">
    <p><strong>Q7: What makes swamps unique among wetlands?</strong></p>
    <button class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer">
        Swamps are unique because:<br>
        - They are dominated by trees, unlike other wetland types<br>
        - They combine characteristics of forests and wetlands<br>
        - They provide vertical habitat structure due to trees<br>
        - They support diverse wildlife at different vertical levels

        Key differences between fens and bogs:<br>
        Fens:<br>
        - Dominated by grasses<br>
        - Typically have flowing water<br><br>
        Bogs:<br>
        - Accumulate peat<br>
        - Often have moss growth<br>
        - Usually have stagnant water

<div class="question">
    <p><strong>Q10: Why are wetlands considered transition zones?</strong></p>
    <button class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer">
        Wetlands are transition zones because:<br>
        - They connect aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems<br>
        - They blend characteristics of both water and land<br>
        - They create unique intermediate environments<br>
        - They support species from both aquatic and terrestrial habitats<br>
        - They facilitate gradual changes between ecosystems
