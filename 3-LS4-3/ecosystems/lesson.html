        <div class="section">
            <h2>What Is an Ecosystem?</h2>
            <p>An ecosystem is a community of interacting organisms and their environment. It includes both living things (plants, animals, insects, bacteria) and non-living things (soil, water, air, rocks). Ecosystems come in all sizes - they can be as small as a puddle in your backyard or as large as the entire ocean!</p>
            
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="African_Savanna_Ecosystem_Zebras_Wildebeests.jpg" alt="African Savanna Ecosystem with Zebras and Wildebeests">
                <p class="caption">The African savanna is a vast ecosystem where zebras, wildebeests, and many other animals interact with each other and their environment.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="fun-fact">
                <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Even though rainforests only cover about 6% of Earth's surface, they produce approximately 40% of the oxygen in our atmosphere through photosynthesis! They're like the planet's lungs!</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>Ecosystems aren't just about animals - they're about all the connections between living and non-living things:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Living components:</strong> All plants, animals, insects, bacteria, and other organisms</li>
                <li><strong>Non-living components:</strong> Water, air, soil, rocks, sunlight, temperature</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Some ecosystems provide special services for our whole planet. Besides oxygen production, ecosystems give us food, medicine, and materials like rubber and lumber.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>What Makes a Healthy Ecosystem?</h2>
            
            <p>A healthy ecosystem has many different kinds of organisms. When you think about a forest ecosystem, you might first notice trees, deer, birds, squirrels, and insects. But there are also countless bacteria, fungi, and tiny insects that are equally important!</p>
            
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="vibrant_grasshopper_eating_leaf.jpg" alt="Grasshopper Eating a Leaf">
                <p class="caption">Even small creatures like this grasshopper play important roles in ecosystems. As herbivores, they help control plant growth and serve as food for birds and other animals.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>Every organism in an ecosystem has a specific role to play. For example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Plants create food through photosynthesis</li>
                <li>Some animals eat plants</li>
                <li>Other animals eat those animals</li>
                <li>Decomposers (like fungi and bacteria) break down dead things</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p class="important">Balance is key! All these organisms depend on each other, creating a web of life where each species helps keep the others in check.</p>
            
            <div class="think-about">
                <p><strong>Think About It:</strong> What might happen if all the frogs disappeared from a pond ecosystem? The insect population might grow out of control since frogs eat insects. This shows how removing one type of organism can affect the whole ecosystem!</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Survival Needs in Ecosystems</h2>
            
            <p>For organisms to survive in an ecosystem, their specific needs must be met:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Food:</strong> All animals need to eat, whether they consume plants, other animals, or both</li>
                <li><strong>Water:</strong> Essential for all living things</li>
                <li><strong>Air:</strong> Animals need oxygen to breathe</li>
                <li><strong>Shelter:</strong> Places to hide from predators or bad weather</li>
                <li><strong>Space:</strong> Room to find food, mates, and raise young</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="bird_nest.jpg" alt="Bird Nest with Birds">
                <p class="caption">This bird nest is an example of shelter - a crucial need for many animals. Birds build nests to protect their eggs and young from predators and weather.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>If these needs aren't met, organisms must adapt, move elsewhere, or they might not survive. For example, if deer need to eat grass and their ecosystem no longer has grass, they must move somewhere else or risk not surviving.</p>
            
            <div class="activity">
                <p><strong>Mini-Activity:</strong> Think about what YOU need to survive. Make a list of your needs (food, water, shelter) and compare them to what a wild animal might need. How are they similar? How are they different?</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Ecosystems in Balance: Predator-Prey Relationships</h2>
            
            <p>In a healthy ecosystem, predator-prey relationships help keep populations at the right size. Predators (animals that hunt other animals) help control the number of prey (animals that get eaten). This creates a natural balance.</p>
            
            <p>Here's how it works:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>When prey animals (like rabbits) have lots of food, their population grows</li>
                <li>More prey means more food for predators (like foxes), so predator numbers increase</li>
                <li>More predators eat more prey, reducing the prey population</li>
                <li>With less prey available, some predators don't get enough food, so their numbers decrease</li>
                <li>With fewer predators, prey populations can increase again</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>This up-and-down cycle helps keep the ecosystem balanced, making sure no single species takes over completely.</p>
            
            <div class="fun-fact">
                <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> A single pair of rabbits could theoretically produce more than 30 million descendants in just 5 years if they had no predators! That's why predators are so important for keeping ecosystems balanced.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>When Ecosystems Get Disrupted</h2>
            
            <p>Sometimes ecosystems get thrown out of balance. This can happen naturally (like from a fire or flood), but humans often cause disruptions too.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Ways humans can disrupt ecosystems:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pollution:</strong> Adding harmful chemicals to air, water, or soil</li>
                <li><strong>Deforestation:</strong> Cutting down forests for lumber or to clear land</li>
                <li><strong>Land development:</strong> Building houses, roads, or shopping centers</li>
                <li><strong>Over-harvesting resources:</strong> Taking too much water, fish, or other resources</li>
                <li><strong>Using pesticides unwisely:</strong> Killing helpful insects along with pests</li>
                <li><strong>Introducing invasive species:</strong> Bringing non-native organisms into a new area</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>The Problem with Pesticides and Fertilizers</h3>
            
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="spraying_fertilizer.jpg" alt="Spraying Fertilizer on a Field">
                <p class="caption">While fertilizers help crops grow, using too much can harm ecosystems. Excess fertilizer often washes into waterways, causing problems for aquatic life.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>When farmers use too many pesticides to kill insects that eat their crops, these chemicals can kill many helpful insects too. This means less food for animals that eat insects (like birds and frogs). The whole ecosystem suffers!</p>
            
            <p>Too much fertilizer can run off into lakes and streams. There, it causes algae to grow rapidly. When the algae die, the process of decomposition uses up oxygen in the water, making it hard for fish and other water animals to breathe!</p>
            
            <div class="think-about">
                <p><strong>Think About It:</strong> How might cutting down a forest affect the animals that live there? Where would they go? What would they eat? Would they all be able to survive the change?</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Invasive Species: Unwelcome Visitors</h2>
            
            <p>Invasive species are living things not naturally found in an ecosystem. When they arrive, they often cause big problems because they have no natural predators to keep their numbers in check.</p>
            
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="warthog_family_graing.jpg" alt="Warthog Family Grazing">
                <p class="caption">Similar to wild pigs in the United States, warthogs can be destructive when introduced to areas where they don't naturally belong. They dig up soil and can damage plant life.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>For example, wild pigs were introduced to the United States centuries ago. Today, they:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cause billions of dollars of damage to crops</li>
                <li>Eat turkey eggs and other small animals</li>
                <li>Destroy native plants by digging up the soil</li>
                <li>Reproduce quickly without natural predators to control their population</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>When invasive species enter an ecosystem, three things can happen to the existing animals:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>They adapt and stay in that ecosystem</li>
                <li>They die because they can't compete with the invaders</li>
                <li>They move somewhere else to find a new home</li>
            </ol>
            
            <div class="fun-fact">
                <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Kudzu, a vine from Asia, grows so quickly in the southeastern United States that it's nicknamed "the vine that ate the South." It can grow up to a foot per day and completely cover trees, houses, and even abandoned cars!</p>

            <h2>Amazing Examples of Ecosystems</h2>
            
            <h3>Tiny Ecosystems: Even a Puddle Counts!</h3>
            
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="puddle.jpg" alt="Small Puddle Ecosystem">
                <p class="caption">This small puddle is its own ecosystem! It contains water, algae, tiny insects, and microorganisms all interacting with each other.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>A small puddle can be its own ecosystem. It might contain water, algae, mosquito larvae, bacteria, and tiny crustaceans. All the organisms needed for a well-balanced mini-ecosystem can exist in this small space. Each creature has a role to play!</p>
            
            <h3>Desktop Ecosystems: Ecospheres</h3>
            
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="ecosphere.jpg" alt="Ecosphere - Self-contained Ecosystem">
                <p class="caption">An ecosphere is a completely sealed, self-sustaining ecosystem. These tiny worlds contain water, algae, and shrimp in perfect balance.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>Ecospheres are tiny, completely sealed ecosystems you can keep on your desk. They contain water, algae, and tiny shrimp in a perfect balance. The algae produce oxygen through photosynthesis (using light energy), the shrimp breathe the oxygen and eat the algae, and the shrimp's waste provides nutrients for the algae to grow. All they need is light!</p>
            
            <h3>Massive Ecosystems: Savannas and Rainforests</h3>
            
            <p>Savannas, like the one shown with zebras at the beginning of our lesson, are grassland ecosystems with scattered trees. They support a wide variety of grazing animals and their predators.</p>
            
            <p>Rainforests are densely packed with countless different plants, animals, and other organisms. They get a lot of rain (about 100 inches per year), which allows for incredible biodiversity. Scientists believe that millions of species in rainforests haven't even been discovered yet!</p>
            
            <h3>Freshwater Ecosystems</h3>
            <p>Lakes, rivers, and ponds have their own ecosystems too. They include fish, crabs, shrimp, turtles, plants, algae, dead wood, and rocks. The plants provide oxygen and food, while dead logs and rocks provide shelter for small creatures.</p>
            
            <div class="activity">
                <p><strong>Mini-Activity:</strong> Look around your neighborhood or a nearby park. Can you identify a small ecosystem? What living and non-living things does it contain? How do they interact with each other?</p>

            <h2>Protecting Our Ecosystems</h2>
            
            <p>Every ecosystem, no matter how big or small, plays an important role in our world. When we protect and take care of ecosystems, we're helping all the plants and animals that live there—and ourselves too!</p>
            
            <p><strong>Ways we can help protect ecosystems:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduce pollution by properly disposing of trash and chemicals</li>
                <li>Conserve water to help aquatic ecosystems</li>
                <li>Plant native trees and plants in your yard</li>
                <li>Learn about invasive species and avoid introducing them</li>
