        <h1>Air Masses & Weather Fronts</h1>
        
        <div class="concept-box">
            <h2>Introduction to Air Masses</h2>
            <p>Air masses are large bodies of air that have similar temperature and humidity throughout. They play a crucial role in determining weather patterns across the globe. These massive volumes of air take on the characteristics of the surface over which they form, whether it's over land or water, near the poles or the equator.</p>
            <p class="key-point">Air masses are defined by two key characteristics: temperature and humidity.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="Global_Air_Masses_Distribution_Map.jpg" alt="Global Air Masses Distribution Map">
            <p class="caption">Global distribution of different air masses. Notice how air masses form over specific geographic regions and take on the characteristics of these regions.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Characteristics of Air Masses</h2>
        <p>Air masses develop their characteristics based on the regions where they form. There are approximately 20 different air masses across Earth's surface. These air masses can be categorized based on their temperature and moisture content:</p>
        
        <table>

                <th>Temperature</th>

                <td>Cold air masses (e.g., Arctic, Antarctic)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Equator</td>
                <td>Warm</td>
                <td>Varies</td>

                <td>Continental air masses</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

            <p class="caption">Different types of air masses that affect North America. Note how they originate from distinct source regions with specific temperature and humidity characteristics.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="activity">
            <h3>Think About It:</h3>
            <p>If an air mass forms over the Arctic Ocean, what characteristics would it likely have? What if it forms over the Sahara Desert?</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Movement of Air Masses</h2>
        <p>Air masses don't stay in one place. They move across Earth's surface, driven by prevailing winds that blow consistently in one direction. These prevailing winds are part of Earth's global wind patterns, which result from the uneven heating of Earth's surface.</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="Global_Air_Circulation_Weather_Fronts_Earth.jpg" alt="Global Air Circulation Weather Fronts Earth">
            <p class="caption">Global air circulation patterns that move air masses around the Earth. These circulation patterns are driven by the uneven heating of Earth's surface.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="concept-box">
            <h3>What Causes Air Masses to Move?</h3>
            <p>Prevailing winds are responsible for moving air masses around the atmosphere. These winds develop because of differences in air pressure, which ultimately arise from the uneven heating of Earth's surface by the sun.</p>
            <p class="key-point">Without prevailing winds, air masses would remain stationary, and weather patterns would be much more predictable and less dynamic.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Convection Cells and Wind Formation</h2>
        <p>Wind is created by the uneven heating of air, which creates convection cells - circular patterns of air movement. Here's how the process works:</p>
        
        <div class="diagram">
            <h3>How Convection Cells Work</h3>
            <p>1. When air warms up: molecules spread out → air becomes less dense → air rises</p>
            <p>2. When air cools down: molecules move closer together → air becomes denser → air sinks</p>
            <p>3. This rising and sinking creates circular air movement patterns called convection cells</p>
            <p>4. The horizontal movement of air in these convection cells creates wind</p>
        </div>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <p>At the molecular level, heating causes air molecules to gain energy and move faster, increasing the space between them. This makes warm air less dense than cool air. Cooling has the opposite effect, causing molecules to slow down and pack more tightly together, creating denser air that sinks.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Weather Fronts: When Air Masses Collide</h2>
        <p>Weather fronts form at the boundaries between air masses with different characteristics. When these giant bodies of air meet, they don't mix easily. Instead, they create a boundary called a front, which often brings significant weather changes.</p>

            <p class="caption">Diagram of a cold front showing how a cold air mass pushes beneath a warm air mass, forcing the warm air to rise and creating clouds and precipitation.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="concept-box">
            <h3>Definition of a Weather Front</h3>
            <p>A weather front is the boundary between two air masses with different temperature, humidity, or density characteristics. Weather fronts are where the most dramatic weather changes occur.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Types of Weather Fronts</h2>
        <p>Meteorologists identify several distinct types of weather fronts, each causing different weather conditions:</p>
        
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Type of Front</th>
                <th>Description</th>
                <th>Weather Conditions</th>
                <th>Map Symbol</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Cold Front</td>
                <td>A cold air mass pushes a warm air mass out of the way</td>
                <td>Abrupt temperature drop, heavy rain, thunderstorms, clearing skies afterward</td>
                <td>Blue line with triangles pointing in the direction of movement</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

                <td>A warm air mass pushes a cold air mass out of the way</td>

            <tr>

                <td>Neither air mass is strong enough to displace the other</td>
                <td>Prolonged periods of cloudy, wet weather with little temperature change</td>
                <td>Alternating blue triangles and red semicircles on opposite sides of the line</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Occluded Front</td>
                <td>A faster-moving cold front catches up to a warm front, lifting the warm air mass off the ground</td>

                <td>Purple line with alternating triangles and semicircles on the same side</td>

            <p class="caption">Cumulonimbus cloud formation resulting from a weather front. These towering clouds often develop when warm air is forced upward at a frontal boundary, creating thunderstorms.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h3>Cold Front Formation and Weather</h3>
            <p>When a cold front approaches, dramatic weather changes often occur. As the dense cold air mass pushes under the warm air mass, it forces the warm air to rise rapidly. This rapid lifting cools the warm air, causing water vapor to condense and form clouds. The result is often:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sharp temperature drops</li>
                <li>Strong winds as the front passes</li>
                <li>Heavy, sometimes thundery showers</li>
                <li>Clearing skies and cooler temperatures after the front passes</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="activity">
            <h3>Visualize It:</h3>
            <p>Imagine a cold front approaching your area. The current temperature is 75°F (24°C) with high humidity. Draw or describe the sequence of weather changes you would expect to experience over the next 24 hours as the front passes through.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>How Air Masses Interact: The Physics Behind Weather</h2>
        <p>When air masses collide, their physical properties determine how they interact:</p>
        
        <div class="concept-box">
            <h3>Density Determines Movement</h3>
            <p>Cold air is denser than warm air, so when cold and warm air masses meet, the cold air tends to push underneath the warm air, forcing it upward. This upward motion of warm air is crucial for cloud formation and precipitation.</p>
            <p class="key-point">The difference in density between air masses is a key driver of vertical air movement, which is essential for weather development.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="check-understanding">
            <h3>Check Your Understanding:</h3>
            <p>Why does a cold air mass typically push a warm air mass upward when they meet? Think about the molecular behavior and density differences between cold and warm air.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Weather Prediction and Air Masses</h2>
        <p>Meteorologists track the movement of air masses and the formation of weather fronts to predict weather conditions. This is a complex process that involves:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Satellite imagery to track air mass movements</li>
            <li>Weather balloons to measure atmospheric conditions at different altitudes</li>
            <li>Computer models that simulate atmospheric interactions</li>
            <li>Ground-based weather stations to collect real-time data</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="WeatherBalloonLaunch_AtmosphericDataCollection.jpg" alt="Weather Balloon Launch for Atmospheric Data Collection">
            <p class="caption">A meteorologist launching a weather balloon to collect data about temperature, humidity, and air pressure at different altitudes. This data helps track air masses and predict weather changes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h3>Weather Prediction and Probability</h3>
            <p>Weather forecasting is not an exact science, which is why meteorologists use probability in their predictions. For example, a "70% chance of rain" means that, based on current data and models, there is a 70% probability that measurable precipitation will occur at any given point in the forecast area during the specified time period.</p>
            <p>As technology advances, weather predictions are becoming more accurate, but the complex nature of atmospheric interactions means that some uncertainty will always remain.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Practical Applications: Reading Weather Maps</h2>
        <p>Weather maps use standardized symbols to represent different weather fronts and air masses. Understanding these symbols can help you interpret weather forecasts:</p>
        
        <div class="diagram">
            <h3>Weather Map Symbols</h3>
            <p>Cold Front: Blue line with triangles (▲▲▲)</p>
            <p>Warm Front: Red line with semicircles (●●●)</p>
            <p>Stationary Front: Alternating triangles and semicircles on opposite sides of the line (▲●▲●)</p>
            <p>Occluded Front: Purple line with alternating triangles and semicircles on the same side</p>
            <p>High Pressure: H</p>
            <p>Low Pressure: L</p>
