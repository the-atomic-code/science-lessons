    <h1>Air Masses & Weather Fronts: The Science Behind Our Weather</h1>
    
    <div class="concept-section">
        <h2>What's Moving Our Weather?</h2>
        <p>Our weather is constantly changing because of giant bodies of air called <strong>air masses</strong> that move around Earth's atmosphere. These air masses have similar temperature and humidity throughout, and when they meet each other, they create <strong>weather fronts</strong> that can bring dramatic changes in our weather!</p>
        
        <h3>Air Masses: Nature's Weather Engines</h3>
        <p>Air masses are like huge bubbles of air that cover thousands of square miles and take on the characteristics of the area where they formed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Air masses that form near the poles tend to be <strong>cold</strong></li>
            <li>Air masses that form near the equator tend to be <strong>warm</strong></li>
            <li>Air masses that form over water tend to be <strong>wet</strong> (high humidity)</li>
            <li>Air masses that form over land tend to be <strong>dry</strong> (low humidity)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Did you know there are about 20 different air masses around Earth? They're constantly moving due to <strong>prevailing winds</strong>, which are winds that blow mostly in one direction.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="cool-fact">
        <p><strong>Cool Weather Fact:</strong> When meteorologists draw weather maps, they use special symbols to represent different weather fronts: a red line with semicircles for warm fronts and a blue line with triangles for cold fronts!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="concept-section">
        <h2>Why Does Warm Air Rise?</h2>
        <p>One of the most important principles in weather science is that <strong>warm air rises above cooler air</strong>. But why?</p>
        <p>When air gets heated, the molecules inside it move faster and spread out more. This makes the warm air <strong>less dense</strong> than the surrounding cooler air. Since it's less dense, it floats upward, just like a balloon filled with helium rises in the air.</p>
        <p>This rising and sinking of air with different temperatures creates <strong>convection cells</strong>, which are responsible for moving air around our planet and creating wind!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="activity-section">
        <h2>Hands-On Activity: Warm Air Rises DIY Spiral</h2>
        <p>Let's see this amazing scientific principle in action with a simple but fascinating experiment!</p>
        
        <h3>Materials Needed:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Paper plate</li>
            <li>1 Pencil</li>
            <li>1 Pair of scissors</li>
            <li>1 Roll of string</li>
            <li>1 Hot plate (or a radiator, space heater, or other heat source)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="safety-warning">
            <p><strong>SAFETY FIRST!</strong> Adult supervision is required for this activity, especially when using the hot plate. The hot plate will be very hot and can cause burns if touched.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <div class="steps">
            <ol>
                <li>Draw a spiral on the paper plate with your pencil, starting from the edge and working your way to the center.</li>
                <li>With your scissors, carefully cut along the pencil line to create a spiral shape.</li>
                <li>Poke a small hole in the center of the spiral with your pencil.</li>
                <li>Tie a piece of string (about 12 inches long) through the hole.</li>
                <li>With adult supervision, turn on the hot plate and let it warm up. (The hotter it gets, the better the experiment will work!)</li>
                <li>Hold your spiral by the string and carefully position it about 12 inches above the hot plate.</li>
                <li>Watch what happens! Your spiral should begin to spin!</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="concept-section">
        <h2>How Does Our Spiral Activity Work?</h2>
        <p>The paper plate spiral spins because the hot plate is heating the air directly beneath it. This air becomes less dense and rises upward, creating a current of moving air.</p>
        <p>As this warm air rises, it passes through the cuts in your spiral, pushing against the paper and causing it to rotate. It's like a mini weather system right in your hands!</p>
        <p>This same principle happens in Earth's atmosphere on a much larger scale:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The Sun heats the Earth's surface unevenly</li>
            <li>Some areas become warmer than others</li>
            <li>Air above warm areas becomes less dense and rises</li>
            <li>Cooler air moves in to fill the space left by the rising warm air</li>
            <li>This creates wind and helps move air masses around the planet</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="concept-section">
        <h2>Weather Fronts: When Air Masses Collide!</h2>
        <p>When different air masses meet, they create boundaries called <strong>weather fronts</strong>. Just like how your spiral responded to the rising warm air, these fronts create dramatic changes in our weather!</p>
        
        <h3>Types of Weather Fronts:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cold Front:</strong> Occurs when a cold air mass pushes a warm air mass out of the way. The cold air, being denser, forces the warm air to rise quickly, often causing heavy rain, thunderstorms, and strong winds.</li>
            <li><strong>Warm Front:</strong> Occurs when a warm air mass pushes a cold air mass out of the way. The warm air slides over the cold air gradually, often bringing steady, light precipitation.</li>
            <li><strong>Stationary Front:</strong> Forms when two air masses meet but neither one pushes the other out of the way. Weather at a stationary front can persist for days.</li>
            <li><strong>Occluded Front:</strong> Happens when a fast-moving cold front catches up to a warm front, lifting the warm air mass off the ground. This often results in heavy rain.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="cool-fact">
        <p><strong>Weather Connection:</strong> In our spiral activity, we created a mini weather system! The hot plate acts like the Sun heating Earth's surface, the rising warm air demonstrates how air moves in the atmosphere, and the spinning spiral shows how this movement of air can create motion and energy - just like how weather systems form!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question-section">
        <h2>Test Your Knowledge!</h2>
        
        <h3>Question 1: Why does warm air rise?</h3>
        <button onclick="toggleAnswer('answer1')">Show Answer</button>
        <p id="answer1" class="answer">Warm air rises because when air is heated, its molecules move faster and spread out more, making it less dense than cooler air around it. Since it's less dense, it floats upward through the denser cool air, just like a balloon.</p>
        
        <h3>Question 2: How did our paper spiral demonstrate the principle that warm air rises?</h3>
        <button onclick="toggleAnswer('answer2')">Show Answer</button>
        <p id="answer2" class="answer">The hot plate heated the air beneath the spiral, causing that air to become less dense and rise. As this warm air rose through the spiral, it pushed against the paper, causing the spiral to rotate. This demonstrated that warm air was indeed rising from the hot plate.</p>
        
        <h3>Question 3: What happens when two different air masses meet?</h3>
        <button onclick="toggleAnswer('answer3')">Show Answer</button>
        <p id="answer3" class="answer">When two different air masses meet, they form a weather front. Since the air masses have different temperatures and humidity levels, they don't mix easily. Instead, they create boundaries where significant weather changes can occur, such as rain, storms, and temperature changes.</p>
        
        <h3>Question 4: How is our spiral activity similar to how winds are created on Earth?</h3>
        <button onclick="toggleAnswer('answer4')">Show Answer</button>
        <p id="answer4" class="answer">In our activity, the hot plate created uneven heating, causing air to rise and create movement (spinning the spiral). Similarly, on Earth, the Sun heats different parts of the planet unevenly. Air above warmer areas rises, creating low pressure, while cooler air moves in to replace it. This movement of air from high pressure to low pressure areas creates wind.</p>
        
        <h3>Question 5: What type of weather front often brings thunderstorms?</h3>
        <button onclick="toggleAnswer('answer5')">Show Answer</button>
        <p id="answer5" class="answer">Cold fronts often bring thunderstorms. This happens because the cold air mass forces warm air to rise rapidly. As the warm air rises, it cools and condenses, forming clouds. The rapid upward movement and condensation can create thunderstorms with heavy rain, lightning, and sometimes hail or tornadoes.</p>

    <div class="activity-section">
        <h2>Extension Activities</h2>
        <h3>Try This!</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Compare Heat Sources:</strong> Try using different heat sources (always with adult supervision) to see if the spiral spins faster or slower. You could try a candle (at a safe distance), a hot radiator, or even a sunny windowsill.</li>
            <li><strong>Spiral Designs:</strong> Try cutting different spiral patterns or using different materials. Does a wider or narrower spiral work better? What about using aluminum foil instead of a paper plate?</li>
            <li><strong>Weather Watching:</strong> For a week, check the daily weather forecast and try to identify what type of front might be causing the weather. Look for clues like temperature changes, cloud patterns, and precipitation.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="concept-section">
        <h2>Real-World Connections</h2>
        <p>The principles you've learned today help meteorologists predict the weather! By tracking air masses and the fronts they create, scientists can make forecasts about what weather to expect in the coming days.</p>
        <p>Next time you see a weather forecast showing weather fronts moving across a map, you'll understand the science behind why the weather is changing!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="cool-fact">
        <p><strong>Amazing Weather Fact:</strong> The largest air masses can be as big as covering the entire United States or even larger! They can take days or weeks to move across continents and oceans.</p>
