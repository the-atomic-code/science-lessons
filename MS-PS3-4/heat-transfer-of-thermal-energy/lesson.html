            <strong>Big Idea:</strong> Heat is not what you might think! It's not the "hotness" of something, but rather the <strong>transfer of thermal energy</strong> from one object to another.

                <h3>What is Temperature?</h3>
                <p>Temperature is what a thermometer reads, but what does that really mean? To understand this, we need to think about substances in two ways:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Macroscopic level:</strong> What we can see with our eyes (like a cup of coffee sitting still)</li>
                    <li><strong>Particle level:</strong> The atoms and molecules that make up the substance (too small to see, but constantly moving!)</li>

        <h3>What is Thermal Energy?</h3>
        <p>Thermal energy is the total energy contained within a system due to the motion of all its particles. It depends on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How fast the particles are moving (temperature)</li>
            <li>How many particles there are (mass)</li>

            <img src="heat_transfer_methods_conduction_convection_radiation.jpg" alt="Three methods of heat transfer">
            <div class="image-caption">The three fundamental methods of heat transfer: conduction (direct contact), convection (fluid movement), and radiation (electromagnetic waves)</div>
        </div>

        <h3>1. Conduction ü§ù</h3>
        <div class="side-by-side">
            <div class="text-content">
                <p>Conduction is the transfer of thermal energy through <strong>direct contact</strong> between particles. Think of it like a chain reaction of particle collisions!</p>

                <div class="key-concept">
                    <strong>How Conduction Works:</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Fast-moving particles (hot end) bump into slower particles (cool end)</li>
                        <li>Energy transfers from fast particles to slow particles</li>
                        <li>No particles actually move from place to place - just energy!</li>
                        <li>This continues along the entire object</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="image-content">
                <img src="conduction_heat_transfer_diagram.jpg" alt="Conduction heat transfer diagram">
                <div class="image-caption">Conduction occurs when fast-moving particles transfer energy to slower-moving particles through direct contact</div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="experiment-box">
            <strong>Conduction in Action:</strong> Imagine heating one end of a copper bar with chocolate pieces on the other end. The copper atoms at the hot end start "wiggling" more vigorously, bumping into their neighbors, passing energy along until the chocolate melts!
        </div>

        <div class="diagram-explanation">
            <strong>Analyzing the Conduction Diagram:</strong> In the diagram above, notice how the particles at the heated end are moving rapidly (shown with longer motion lines), and this energy gradually transfers through particle collisions to the cooler end. The temperature gradient shows how heat flows from high to low temperature regions.
        </div>

        <p><strong>Best conductors:</strong> Metals (like copper, iron, aluminum)<br>
        <strong>Poor conductors (insulators):</strong> Wood, plastic, air</p>

        <h3>2. Convection üåä</h3>
        <div class="side-by-side">
            <div class="text-content">
                <p>Convection is the transfer of thermal energy through the <strong>circulation of fluids</strong> (liquids and gases). The heated fluid itself moves, carrying energy with it!</p>

                <div class="key-concept">
                    <strong>How Convection Works:</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Fluid gets heated and expands (particles move faster and spread out)</li>
                        <li>Heated fluid becomes less dense and rises</li>
                        <li>Cooler, denser fluid sinks to replace it</li>
                        <li>This creates circulation currents that transfer energy</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
            </div>

                <div class="image-caption">Convection currents form when heated fluid rises and cooler fluid sinks, creating a circulation pattern</div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="experiment-box">
            <strong>Convection in Action:</strong> When you heat water in a pot, the water at the bottom gets hot first, becomes less dense, and rises. Cool water from the top sinks down to be heated. This creates swirling currents that distribute heat throughout the water!
        </div>

        <div class="diagram-explanation">
            <strong>Understanding the Convection Diagram:</strong> The arrows in the diagram show the circulation pattern - hot fluid (red) rises on one side while cool fluid (blue) descends on the other. This continuous circulation efficiently transfers thermal energy throughout the fluid.
        </div>

        <div class="think-about">
            üí° Common Mistake: People say "heat rises," but it's more accurate to say "heated fluid rises" because the warm fluid carries the thermal energy upward.
        </div>

        <p><strong>Where you see convection:</strong> Heating systems in homes, weather patterns, ocean currents, boiling water</p>

        <h3>3. Radiation ‚òÄÔ∏è</h3>
        <div class="side-by-side">
            <div class="text-content">
                <p>Radiation is the transfer of thermal energy through <strong>electromagnetic waves</strong>. No matter needs to be present - energy can travel through empty space!</p>

                <div class="key-concept">
                    <strong>How Radiation Works:</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>All objects emit electromagnetic waves based on their temperature</li>
                        <li>These waves carry energy through space</li>
                        <li>When waves hit another object, the energy is absorbed</li>
                        <li>The absorbed energy increases the kinetic energy of particles in the receiving object</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="image-content">
                <img src="radiation_heat_transfer_campfire.jpg" alt="Radiation heat transfer from campfire">
                <div class="image-caption">A campfire demonstrates radiation - you feel the heat even without direct contact because electromagnetic waves carry thermal energy through the air</div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="experiment-box">
            <strong>Radiation in Action:</strong> Sitting by a campfire, you feel warm even without touching the fire or having hot air blow on you. The fire emits infrared radiation that travels through the air and is absorbed by your skin!
        </div>

        <p><strong>Examples of radiation:</strong> Sunlight warming Earth, feeling heat from a fireplace, heat lamps, microwave ovens</p>

        <h2>‚ö° Factors Affecting the Rate of Heat Transfer</h2>

        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="heat_transfer_temperature_diagram.jpg" alt="Heat transfer temperature diagram">
            <div class="image-caption">This diagram shows how temperature differences drive heat transfer - the greater the difference, the faster the transfer rate</div>
        </div>

        <h3>1. Amount of Substance (Mass)</h3>
        <div class="think-about">
            ü§î Which cools down faster: tea in a cup or tea in a spoon? The spoon! With fewer particles, thermal energy transfers away more quickly.
        </div>

        <p><strong>Key Principle:</strong> More mass = more thermal energy, but <span class="highlight">less mass = faster rate of temperature change</span></p>

        <h3>2. Type of Material</h3>
        <p>Different materials have different abilities to store and transfer thermal energy. This is called <strong>heat capacity</strong>.</p>

        <div class="experiment-box">
            <strong>Material Comparison:</strong> If you heat equal masses of iron, tin, and bismuth to the same temperature and drop them into identical containers of cool water:
            <ul>
                <li>Iron increases water temperature by 30¬∞C</li>
                <li>Tin increases water temperature by 15¬∞C</li>
                <li>Bismuth increases water temperature by 5¬∞C</li>
            </ul>
            This shows that iron transfers energy most easily, while bismuth holds onto its energy longer!
        </div>

        <h3>3. Temperature Difference</h3>
        <p>The greater the temperature difference between objects, the faster heat transfer occurs.</p>

        <h3>4. Surface Area</h3>
        <p>More surface area allows for faster heat transfer because there's more contact between substances.</p>
