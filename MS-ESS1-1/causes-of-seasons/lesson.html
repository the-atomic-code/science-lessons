        <h1>Earth's Seasons: The Cosmic Dance of Light and Tilt</h1>
        
        <div class="concept-box">
            <p>The four divisions of the year (spring, summer, fall and winter) are marked by distinct weather patterns and variations in daylight hours across different regions of our planet. But what causes these seasonal changes? In this lesson, we'll explore how Earth's position in space and its unique characteristics create the rhythm of seasons that shape our lives.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Primary Cause of Seasons: Earth's Tilt</h2>
        
        <p>Contrary to popular belief, Earth's distance from the Sun is <strong>not</strong> the main cause of seasons. The primary cause is Earth's <span class="highlight">tilt of axis</span>.</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="Earth_Axial_Tilt_23.5_Degrees.jpg" alt="Earth's 23.5° tilt on its axis">
            <p class="caption">Earth's axis is tilted at precisely 23.5° relative to its orbital plane around the Sun</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="concept-box">
            <h3>Earth's Axis and Its Tilt</h3>
            <p>Earth spins around its axis once every 24 hours. The axis is an imaginary line that runs through the center of Earth from the North Pole to the South Pole. This axis is tilted at an angle of <span class="highlight">23.5°</span> relative to the plane of Earth's orbit around the Sun.</p>
            <p>This tilt remains pointed in the same direction in space throughout the year, but its orientation relative to the Sun changes as Earth orbits around our star.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fun-fact">
            <h3>Fun Fact!</h3>
            <p>If Earth had no axial tilt (0°), we would have no seasons! Each location would experience the same amount of sunlight and darkness every day of the year.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>How Tilt Creates Seasons</h2>
        
        <p>As Earth orbits the Sun, its tilted axis causes different parts of the planet to receive varying amounts of solar radiation throughout the year:</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="Earth_Day_Night_Cycle_Solar_Illumination.jpg" alt="Earth's day and night cycle with solar illumination">
            <p class="caption">The illumination of Earth creates day and night as our planet rotates, but the tilt causes varying day lengths throughout the year</p>
        </div>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>June (Summer Solstice in Northern Hemisphere):</strong> The Northern Hemisphere and North Pole point toward the Sun. This hemisphere receives more direct sunlight and experiences summer.</li>
            <li><strong>December (Winter Solstice in Northern Hemisphere):</strong> The Southern Hemisphere and South Pole point toward the Sun. This hemisphere receives more direct sunlight and experiences summer, while the Northern Hemisphere experiences winter.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="Earth_Axis_Sunlight_Distribution_Major_Latitude_Lines.jpg" alt="Earth's axis and sunlight distribution across major latitude lines">
            <p class="caption">Earth's axial tilt affects how sunlight is distributed across different latitudes throughout the year</p>
        </div>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h3>Key Concept: Opposite Seasons</h3>
            <p>When the Northern Hemisphere experiences summer, the Southern Hemisphere experiences winter, and vice versa. This is because when one hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun, the other is necessarily tilted away.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Light Intensity and Seasons</h2>
        
        <p>Light is a form of energy that travels through space. The amount of solar energy reaching Earth's surface depends on the angle at which sunlight strikes the surface.</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="Sunlight_Angle_Earth_Atmosphere_Effect.jpg" alt="Sunlight angle and its effect on Earth's atmosphere">
            <p class="caption">The angle at which sunlight strikes Earth affects its intensity and how much energy is absorbed</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="concept-box">
            <h3>How Angle Affects Light Intensity</h3>
            <p>When sunlight hits Earth's surface at a <span class="highlight">90° angle</span> (directly overhead), it is most intense and transfers the maximum amount of energy. This is called <span class="highlight">direct sunlight</span>.</p>
            <p>When sunlight hits at a <span class="highlight">smaller angle</span>, the same amount of energy is spread over a larger area, resulting in less intense heating. This is called <span class="highlight">indirect sunlight</span>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="activity">
            <h3>Think About It:</h3>
            <p>During summer in the Northern Hemisphere, sunlight strikes the surface more directly (at angles closer to 90°). This concentrates solar energy into a smaller area, creating higher temperatures.</p>
            <p>During winter in the Northern Hemisphere, sunlight strikes the surface at smaller angles, spreading the same amount of solar energy over a larger area and resulting in lower temperatures.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Latitude: Earth's Horizontal Bands</h2>
        
        <p>Latitude refers to the angular distance north or south of the equator, measured in degrees. The equator is at 0° latitude and divides Earth into the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="Earth_Latitude_Grid_System_Major_Circles.jpg" alt="Earth's latitude grid system showing major circles">
            <p class="caption">Earth's major latitude lines include the Equator (0°), Tropic of Cancer (23.5°N), Tropic of Capricorn (23.5°S), Arctic Circle (66.5°N), and Antarctic Circle (66.5°S)</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="concept-box">
            <h3>Important Lines of Latitude</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Equator (0°):</strong> Divides Earth into Northern and Southern Hemispheres</li>
                <li><strong>Tropic of Cancer (23.5°N):</strong> The northernmost latitude where the Sun can appear directly overhead (at the June solstice)</li>
                <li><strong>Tropic of Capricorn (23.5°S):</strong> The southernmost latitude where the Sun can appear directly overhead (at the December solstice)</li>
                <li><strong>Arctic Circle (66.5°N):</strong> Defines the southernmost point in the Northern Hemisphere where the Sun can remain above or below the horizon for 24 continuous hours</li>
                <li><strong>Antarctic Circle (66.5°S):</strong> Defines the northernmost point in the Southern Hemisphere where the Sun can remain above or below the horizon for 24 continuous hours</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="fun-fact">
            <h3>Connection Alert!</h3>
            <p>Notice that the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn are located at 23.5° north and south of the equator—the same as Earth's axial tilt of 23.5°. This is not a coincidence! These lines mark where the Sun appears directly overhead during the solstices because of Earth's tilt.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Daylight Hours and Seasons</h2>
        
        <p>The number of daylight hours a location receives varies throughout the year, except at the equator.</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="Earth_Seasonal_Daylight_Distribution.jpg" alt="Earth's seasonal daylight distribution" width="800">
            <p class="caption">The distribution of daylight hours varies significantly by latitude and season</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="concept-box">
            <h3>Daylight Patterns Across Earth</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>At the equator:</strong> Approximately 12 hours of daylight year-round</li>
                <li><strong>Between the equator and poles:</strong> Varying daylight hours depending on season and latitude</li>
                <li><strong>At the poles:</strong> Extreme variations, including 24 hours of daylight during summer and 0 hours during winter</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h3>Why does the North Pole experience 24 hours of daylight during the peak of summer?</h3>
            <p>Because Earth's axial tilt causes the North Pole to be constantly facing the Sun during the Northern Hemisphere's summer. As Earth rotates on its axis, the North Pole remains in sunlight throughout the full 24-hour rotation period.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Latitude and Seasonal Extremes</h2>
        
        <p>The further you travel from the equator (north or south), the more extreme the seasonal differences become.</p>
        
        <table>

                <th>Region</th>

                <td>Extreme (from 24 hours to 0 hours)</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <div class="activity">
            <h3>Compare and Contrast:</h3>
            <p>A city at 10° latitude will experience much less seasonal variation in temperature and daylight hours than a city at 60° latitude. The city at 60° latitude will have much longer summer days and much shorter winter days.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Common Misconception: Earth's Distance from the Sun</h2>
        
        <p>Many people incorrectly believe that seasons occur because Earth's distance from the Sun changes throughout the year.</p>
        
        <div class="concept-box">
            <h3>Earth's Orbit</h3>
            <p>Earth's orbit around the Sun is nearly circular. While Earth's distance from the Sun does vary slightly during its orbit (it's closest to the Sun in January and farthest in July), this has a minimal effect on temperatures compared to the effect of axial tilt.</p>
            <p>In fact, the Northern Hemisphere experiences winter when Earth is actually closest to the Sun! This clearly shows that Earth's distance from the Sun is not the primary cause of seasons.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Seasons on Other Planets</h2>
        
        <p>Studying seasons on other planets helps us better understand the factors that create seasons.</p>

        <div class="fun-fact">
            <h3>Planetary Comparison</h3>
            <p>Mars has an axial tilt (25°) most similar to Earth's (23.5°), which gives it seasons most like those on Earth. However, because Mars takes nearly twice as long to orbit the Sun, its seasons last about twice as long as Earth's.</p>

            <p>If Earth had no axial tilt:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>There would be no seasons as we know them</li>
                <li>Each location would receive the same amount of sunlight every day of the year</li>
                <li>The equator would still be warmest, and the poles coldest, but these temperatures would remain constant year-round</li>
                <li>Every day would have equal hours of daylight and darkness (12 hours each)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">
            <h3>What if Earth's axis were tilted more than 23.5°?</h3>
            <p>A greater axial tilt would result in more extreme seasons, with hotter summers and colder winters. The regions experiencing midnight sun and polar night would extend further from the poles.</p>

                <li>Mercury has virtually no axial tilt, so it doesn't experience seasons from tilt. However, its highly elliptical orbit causes temperature variations as its distance from the Sun changes significantly.</li>
                <li>Venus has a very slight tilt of only 3°, resulting in minimal seasonal variation.</li>
                <li>Mars, with its 25° tilt (similar to Earth's 23.5°), experiences seasons comparable to Earth's, but they last longer because Mars takes nearly twice as long to orbit the Sun.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These comparative studies help astronomers better understand the unique factors that create Earth's seasonal patterns.</p>

        <div class="summary">
            <h3>The Four Key Factors of Seasonal Change:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Earth's 23.5° tilt</strong> - The fundamental cause of seasons</li>
                <li><strong>Earth's orbit around the Sun</strong> - Changes which hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun</li>
                <li><strong>Light intensity</strong> - Direct sunlight (90° angle) provides more energy than indirect sunlight</li>
                <li><strong>Latitude</strong> - Determines the angle of sunlight and variations in daylight hours</li>

            <h3>Remember:</h3>
            <p>The primary cause of seasons is Earth's 23.5° tilt on its axis as it orbits the Sun. This tilt causes different parts of Earth to receive varying amounts of direct sunlight throughout the year, creating the cycle of seasons we experience.</p>
