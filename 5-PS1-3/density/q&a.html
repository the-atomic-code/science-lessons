<h1>ðŸŒŠ The Amazing World of Density: Why Things Float or Sink! ðŸªµ</h1>

<div class="fun-fact">
<strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Did you know that a huge steel ship can float on water while a small steel nail sinks? Let's discover why through the magic of density!
</div>

<div class="question">Q1: What is density?</div>
<button class="show-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer1')">Show Answer</button>
<div class="answer" id="answer1">Density is the measure of mass per unit volume of a substance. In simpler terms, it tells us how much matter is packed into a given space.</div>

<div class="question">Q2: Why does a large log of wood float on water while a smaller rock sinks?</div>
<button class="show-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer2')">Show Answer</button>
<div class="answer" id="answer2">
â€¢ The log floats because it has less density than water (less mass per unit volume)<br>
â€¢ The rock sinks because it has greater density than water (more mass per unit volume)
</div>

<div class="question">Q3: What makes a helium balloon rise in the air?</div>
<button class="show-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer3')">Show Answer</button>
<div class="answer" id="answer3">A helium balloon rises because:
<br>â€¢ Helium gas has less density than the surrounding air
<br>â€¢ Objects with lower density rise above substances with higher density</div>

<div class="question">Q4: Why does oil float on water? (There are two reasons!)</div>
<button class="show-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer4')">Show Answer</button>
<div class="answer" id="answer4">Oil floats on water because:
<br>1. Oil has lower density than water
<br>2. Oil and water are immiscible liquids (they don't mix together)</div>

<div class="question">Q5: What happens when you try to mix oil and water?</div>
<button class="show-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer5')">Show Answer</button>
<div class="answer" id="answer5">When you mix oil and water:
<br>â€¢ They initially appear to mix when shaken
<br>â€¢ They separate into two distinct layers when left undisturbed
<br>â€¢ Oil forms the top layer (less dense)
<br>â€¢ Water forms the bottom layer (more dense)</div>

<div class="fun-fact">
<strong>Think About It:</strong> If you had a cube of gold and a cube of aluminum of the same size, which would be heavier? Gold, because it has a higher density!
</div>

<div class="question">Q6: Can you arrange these substances in order of increasing density?</div>
<button class="show-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer6')">Show Answer</button>
<div class="answer" id="answer6">From least dense to most dense:
<br>â€¢ Helium gas
<br>â€¢ Air
<br>â€¢ Oil
<br>â€¢ Water
<br>â€¢ Rock</div>

<div class="question">Q7: What would happen if you put these objects in water?</div>
<button class="show-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer7')">Show Answer</button>
<div class="answer" id="answer7">
â€¢ Cork (less dense than water) â†’ Floats<br>
â€¢ Ice cube (slightly less dense than water) â†’ Floats<br>
â€¢ Grape (about same density as water) â†’ Barely floats<br>
â€¢ Marble (more dense than water) â†’ Sinks<br>
â€¢ Metal key (more dense than water) â†’ Sinks
</div>

<div class="question">Q8: True or False? All large objects sink and all small objects float.</div>
<button class="show-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer8')">Show Answer</button>
<div class="answer" id="answer8">False! An object's ability to float or sink depends on its density, not its size. That's why a huge wooden ship can float while a tiny metal pin sinks.</div>

<div class="question">Q9: What practical applications use the principle of density?</div>
<button class="show-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer9')">Show Answer</button>
<div class="answer" id="answer9">
â€¢ Hot air balloons (heated air is less dense than cool air)<br>
â€¢ Submarines (adjust their density to dive or surface)<br>
â€¢ Oil spill cleanup (oil floats on water)<br>
â€¢ Cream rising to the top of milk<br>
â€¢ Ice floating in drinks
</div>

<div class="question">Q10: Challenge Question: Why does a steel ship float even though steel is denser than water?</div>
<button class="show-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer10')">Show Answer</button>
<div class="answer" id="answer10">A steel ship floats because:
<br>â€¢ The ship's hull is shaped to contain air
<br>â€¢ This creates a large volume with relatively little mass
<br>â€¢ The average density of the ship (steel + air inside) becomes less than water
<br>â€¢ This is called the principle of buoyancy!</div>
