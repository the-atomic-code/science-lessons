<div class="question">
    <h3>Q1: What is electricity in simple terms?</h3>
    <button onclick="toggleAnswer('a1')">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="a1">
        Electricity is the movement of electrons (called electric current) in a circuit.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <h3>Q2: What makes a material a good conductor?</h3>
    <button onclick="toggleAnswer('a2')">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="a2">
        A good conductor has free electrons in its atoms that can move easily, providing a smooth path for electric current to flow.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <h3>Q3: What are the top conducting metals in order?</h3>
    <button onclick="toggleAnswer('a3')">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="a3">
        1. Silver (best conductor but expensive)<br>
        2. Copper (most commonly used)<br>
        3. Gold (used in electronics)<br>
        4. Aluminum (used in power lines)
    </div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <h3>Q4: Why don't we use silver wires in our homes?</h3>
    <button onclick="toggleAnswer('a4')">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="a4">
        Although silver is the best conductor, it's not used in homes because:
        <br>- It's very expensive
        <br>- It oxidizes (tarnishes) easily
        <br>- Copper provides excellent conductivity at a much lower cost
    </div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <h3>Q5: What happens when we use a conductor with high resistance?</h3>
    <button onclick="toggleAnswer('a5')">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="a5">
        When using a conductor with high resistance:
        <br>- It becomes very hot when current flows
        <br>- Wastes electricity by converting it to heat
        <br>- Reduces the efficiency of electrical devices
    </div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <h3>Q6: Where is gold used as a conductor?</h3>
    <button onclick="toggleAnswer('a6')">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="a6">
        Gold is used in:
        <br>- Cell phone circuits
        <br>- Computer chips
        <br>Because it's an excellent conductor and doesn't corrode
    </div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <h3>Q7: Why is aluminum used in power transmission lines?</h3>
    <button onclick="toggleAnswer('a7')">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="a7">
        Aluminum is used because:
        <br>- It's lightweight, making it perfect for overhead lines
        <br>- It's less expensive than copper
        <br>- Though 40% less conductive than copper, it's still good enough for power transmission
    </div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <h3>Q8: What makes a material a good insulator?</h3>
    <button onclick="toggleAnswer('a8')">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="a8">
        A good insulator:
        <br>- Has tightly bound electrons that can't move freely
        <br>- Blocks or resists the flow of electric current
        <br>- Provides protection against electrical shock
    </div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <h3>Q9: What are common insulators used in everyday life?</h3>
    <button onclick="toggleAnswer('a9')">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="a9">
        Common insulators include:
        <br>- Porcelain (used in electrical fixtures)
        <br>- Rubber (used in wire coatings)
        <br>- Plastic (used in electrical casings)
        <br>- Glass (used in light bulbs)
        <br>- Wood (used in electrical poles)
        <br>- Paper (used in some electrical components)
    </div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <h3>Q10: How do insulators help in appliances like refrigerators?</h3>
    <button onclick="toggleAnswer('a10')">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="a10">
        In refrigerators, insulators:
        <br>- Protect against electrical hazards
        <br>- Limit heat gains in the system
        <br>- Reduce the workload on the compressor
        <br>- Help maintain efficient operation
    </div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <h3>Q11: What makes copper a practical choice for home wiring?</h3>
    <button onclick="toggleAnswer('a11')">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="a11">
        Copper is ideal for home wiring because:
        <br>- It has excellent conductivity
        <br>- It's more affordable than silver
        <br>- It's durable and long-lasting
        <br>- It has good resistance to corrosion
    </div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <h3>Q12: Where is silver used as a conductor?</h3>
    <button onclick="toggleAnswer('a12')">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="a12">
        Silver is used in:
        <br>- Printed circuit boards
        <br>- TV screens
        <br>- Specialized electronic applications
        <br>Where its superior conductivity justifies the cost
    </div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <h3>Q13: What are examples of poor insulators?</h3>
    <button onclick="toggleAnswer('a13')">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="a13">
        Poor insulators include:
        <br>- Water
        <br>- Wet wood
        <br>These materials can conduct electricity to some degree, making them potentially dangerous in electrical situations.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <h3>Q14: Why do electrical wires need insulation?</h3>
    <button onclick="toggleAnswer('a14')">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="a14">
        Electrical wires need insulation to:
        <br>- Prevent electric shocks
        <br>- Avoid short circuits
        <br>- Protect the conductor inside
        <br>- Ensure safe electrical transmission

</div>

<div class="fun-fact">
    <strong>Fun Fact! ðŸ’¡</strong> If silver were used instead of copper in all our electrical wiring, most electrical devices would be too expensive for everyday use! That's why choosing the right conductor is about balancing performance with practicality.
