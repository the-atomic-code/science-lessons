    <h2>🌟 The Basics: Let's Heat Things Up!</h2>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <h3>Q1: What makes a material a heat conductor? 🌡️</h3>
    <button id="b1" class="show-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('1')">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="a1">
        Materials that allow thermal energy to flow through them easily are heat conductors. Metals are excellent examples because their atomic structure enables quick and efficient heat transfer.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <h3>Q2: How do heat insulators work their magic? 🛡️</h3>
    <button id="b2" class="show-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('2')">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="a2">
        Heat insulators have a structure that resists the flow of thermal energy. Their molecules are typically farther apart and less organized, making it difficult for heat to transfer through them.

<div class="question">
    <h3>Q3: Why is metal the superstar of cooking pots? ⭐</h3>
    <button id="b3" class="show-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('3')">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="a3">
        Metal excels in cooking pots because it quickly and evenly transfers heat from the stove to the food. This efficient heat conduction ensures uniform cooking and better temperature control.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <h3>Q4: What's the clever science behind plastic pot handles? 🤓</h3>
    <button id="b4" class="show-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('4')">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="a4">
        The plastic handles create a safety barrier by blocking heat transfer. Their insulating properties prevent the thermal energy from reaching your hands, making it safe to handle hot cookware.

    <h2>🧪 The Great Kitchen Experiment!</h2>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <h3>Q5: Why did we use butter in our heat conduction experiment? 🧈</h3>
    <button id="b5" class="show-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('5')">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="a5">
        Butter serves as a visible indicator of heat transfer because it melts at a relatively low temperature. This makes it perfect for demonstrating the different rates of heat conduction through various materials.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <h3>Q6: What's the science behind the falling buttons? 🔽</h3>
    <button id="b6" class="show-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('6')">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="a6">
        The buttons fall in order of their spoons' heat conductivity. Metal conducts heat fastest, quickly melting the butter, while wood and plastic's insulating properties slow down the heat transfer, causing their buttons to fall later.

<div class="question">
    <h3>Q7: How does heat always travel? 🌊</h3>
    <button id="b7" class="show-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('7')">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="a7">
        Thermal energy naturally flows from areas of higher temperature to areas of lower temperature, never the reverse. This fundamental principle governs all heat transfer processes.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <h3>Q8: Why do wooden spoons rule the kitchen? 🥄</h3>
    <button id="b8" class="show-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('8')">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="a8">
        Wood's natural insulating properties make it ideal for kitchen utensils. It won't conduct heat from hot foods to your hand and won't scratch your cookware like metal utensils might.
    </div>

    <h2>🎮 Challenge Your Knowledge!</h2>

<div class="question">
    <h3>Q9: Kitchen Detective: Why don't we make entire pots from plastic? 🔍</h3>
    <button id="b9" class="show-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('9')">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="a9">
        Plastic's insulating properties would prevent effective cooking by blocking heat transfer from the heat source to the food. Additionally, most plastics would melt or release harmful chemicals at cooking temperatures.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <h3>Q10: Temperature Time Machine: Predict what would happen if we used ice water instead of hot water in our spoon experiment! ❄️</h3>
    <button id="b10" class="show-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('10')">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="a10">
        The metal spoon would cool down fastest, followed by wood, then plastic. The butter would harden more quickly on the metal spoon because it conducts cold temperatures just as efficiently as hot ones.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <h3>Q11: Material Master: What makes metal such a great heat conductor? ⚡</h3>
    <button id="b11" class="show-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('11')">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="a11">
        Metals have free electrons and tightly packed atoms that can quickly transfer energy from one area to another, making them excellent conductors of both heat and electricity.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <h3>Q12: Safety Scientist: Design the perfect cooking utensil! 🔬</h3>
    <button id="b12" class="show-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('12')">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="a12">
        The ideal cooking utensil would have a metal or heat-conducting tip for cooking, an insulating handle (like wood or plastic) for safety, and be long enough to keep hands away from heat sources. This combines the benefits of both conductors and insulators.
