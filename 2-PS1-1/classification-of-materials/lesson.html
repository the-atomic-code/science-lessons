            <h2>What is Classification?</h2>
            <p>When we <span class="highlight">classify</span> things, we put them into groups based on shared qualities or properties. Scientists and engineers classify materials to better understand them and decide how to use them.</p>

                <p>Look around your classroom. Can you find 5 objects and put them into groups? What property did you use to group them?</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Classification by Color</h2>
            <p>One of the easiest ways to classify materials is by their <span class="highlight">color</span>. When we classify by color, we put all objects with the same color into one group.</p>

                <p>In the image above, you can see how objects can be sorted by color. This is one of the simplest ways to classify materials. Notice how all the red items are grouped together, all the blue items together, and so on.</p>

                <p>You've just classified objects by their color!</p>

            <h2>Classification by Texture</h2>
            <p><span class="highlight">Texture</span> describes how something feels when you touch it. Is it smooth or rough?</p>

                <p><span class="vocabulary-term">Rough:</span> Having an uneven surface, such as sandpaper.</p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Smooth materials:</strong> glass, plastic, polished wood, silk</p>
                <p><strong>Rough materials:</strong> sandpaper, brick, tree bark, unpolished stone</p>
                <p>Looking at the images above, you can see examples of different textures. Notice how some surfaces appear bumpy or uneven (rough), while others look flat and even (smooth).</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>Texture is very important when designing things. For example, a slide needs to be smooth to make it easy and fun to slide down. Can you imagine trying to slide down a rough, bumpy slide? Ouch!</p>

                <h3>Texture Hunt!</h3>
                <p>Find three smooth objects and three rough objects in your home or classroom. Write down what they are and explain why their texture is important for how they're used.</p>

            <h2>Classification by Hardness</h2>
            <p>We can also classify materials by how <span class="highlight">hard</span> or <span class="highlight">soft</span> they are.</p>

                <p><strong>Soft materials:</strong> cotton, foam, pillows, blankets, clay</p>
                <p>Looking at the image above, you can see examples of hard and soft materials. Hard materials keep their shape and usually feel solid when you press on them. Soft materials might change shape when you press on them.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>Hardness is very important when choosing materials for specific purposes. Building materials need to be hard in order to build strong and sturdy houses or buildings.</p>

                <h3>Hardness Challenge!</h3>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Choosing the Right Materials</h2>
            <p>When we make things, we need to choose materials with the right properties. Here are some examples:</p>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Slide:</strong> Needs to be smooth so people can slide down easily (as shown in the slide image above).</p>
                <p><strong>Hammer:</strong> Needs to be hard so it can push nails into wood.</p>
                <p><strong>Helmet:</strong> Needs to be hard to protect your head.</p>
                <p><strong>Winter coat:</strong> Needs to be soft and warm to keep you comfortable.</p>
                <p><strong>Building materials:</strong> Need to be hard and strong to support weight (as shown in the construction image).</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="think-about">
                Why would it not be a good idea to make a hammer out of clay?
            </div>
            
            <p>Clay isn't hard enough to push a nail through wood. That's why hammers are made of strong materials like metal.</p>
            
            <div class="activity">
                <h3>Design Challenge!</h3>

                <ul>
