    <h1>Amazing Plant Parts and How They Work</h1>
    <div class="section">
    <h2>What Are External Plant Parts?</h2>
    <p>Plants are living things that have special parts on the outside that help them grow, survive, and make new plants. These outside parts are called <span class="highlight">external plant parts</span>. The main external parts of plants are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Stems</li>
        <li>Leaves</li>
        <li>Flowers</li>
        <li>Fruits</li>
        <li>Roots</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="parts_of_plant.jpg" alt="Main parts of a plant showing roots, stem, leaves, and flower">
        <p class="image-caption">The main external parts of a plant work together to help it survive and grow.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="fun-fact">
        <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Many of the foods we eat every day are actually different parts of plants! Can you guess which plant parts you ate today?</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>The Amazing Stem</h2>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">stem</span> is like the body of the plant. It has two very important jobs:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>It holds the plant up straight and strong</li>
        <li>It works like a straw to carry water and food from the roots up to the leaves</li>
    </ol>
    
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="stems_holding_plants_up_1.jpg" alt="Plant stems showing how they support the plant">
        <p class="image-caption">Stems provide the support plants need to stand tall and reach for sunlight.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Without stems, plants would just flop over on the ground and couldn't get tall to reach the sunlight!</p>
    
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="stems_holding_plants_up_2.jpg" alt="Different types of plant stems showing variety">
        <p class="image-caption">Different plants have different types of stems. Some are woody and strong, while others are flexible and green.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p><strong>Plant stems we eat:</strong> Did you know that we eat some plant stems? Some examples are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Celery - those crunchy stalks are actually stems!</li>
        <li>Asparagus - the whole vegetable is a young stem</li>
        <li>Sugar cane - we get sugar from this sweet stem</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="activity">
        <p><strong>Think About It:</strong> How is a plant stem similar to your own body? (Hint: Think about how your skeleton helps you stand up and how blood moves through your body)</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Lovely Leaves</h2>
    <p><span class="highlight">Leaves</span> are like the food-makers of the plant. They have a very special job:</p>
    <p>Leaves catch sunlight and use it to make food for the plant. This process is called <span class="highlight">photosynthesis</span>.</p>
    
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="leaves.jpg" alt="Variety of green leaves showing different shapes and sizes">
        <p class="image-caption">Leaves come in many different shapes and sizes, but most are flat to capture maximum sunlight.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Leaves come in many different shapes and sizes, but most leaves are flat and green. Being flat helps them catch more sunlight, and the green color comes from a special substance that helps turn sunlight into food.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Leaves we eat:</strong> Some tasty leaves include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Spinach</li>
        <li>Lettuce</li>
        <li>Cabbage</li>
        <li>Mint leaves</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="fun-fact">
        <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Some plants have thousands of leaves! An oak tree can have more than 200,000 leaves.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="activity">
        <p><strong>Think About It:</strong> How are leaves like solar panels on houses? How do they both use the sun's energy?</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Fantastic Flowers</h2>
    <p><span class="highlight">Flowers</span> are the beautiful, colorful parts of plants that help make new plants. They have two important jobs:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>They make seeds that can grow into new plants</li>
        <li>They attract helpful animals like bees and butterflies</li>
    </ol>
    
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="flowers.jpg" alt="Colorful flowers showing variety of shapes and colors">
        <p class="image-caption">Flowers are colorful and attractive to help bring pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Flowers are often bright and colorful to catch the attention of animals like bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds. When these animals visit flowers to drink sweet nectar, they help move pollen from one flower to another, which helps flowers make seeds.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Flowers we eat:</strong> Yes, we eat flowers too! Some examples are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Broccoli (the green part is actually tiny flower buds)</li>
        <li>Cauliflower</li>
        <li>Artichokes</li>
        <li>Some people eat rose petals and lavender in special foods</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="activity">
        <p><strong>Think About It:</strong> How are colorful flowers similar to colorful signs and advertisements? How do they both try to get attention?</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Fantastic Fruits</h2>
    <p><span class="highlight">Fruits</span> are the parts of plants that protect the seeds and help them travel to new places. Fruits have two main jobs:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>They protect the seeds inside them</li>
        <li>They help the seeds travel to new places where they can grow</li>
    </ol>
    
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="apples.jpg" alt="Variety of apples showing different colors and sizes">
        <p class="image-caption">Apples are fruits that contain seeds at their core. The tasty flesh attracts animals that help spread the seeds.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Many fruits are sweet and tasty, which makes animals want to eat them. When animals eat fruits, they often carry the seeds away in their tummies and leave them in a new place with their droppings - helping the plant spread its seeds!</p>
    
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="apricots.jpg" alt="Fresh apricots showing the fruit flesh and seed inside">
        <p class="image-caption">Apricots protect their seeds with sweet, juicy flesh that animals love to eat.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p><strong>Fruits we eat:</strong> There are so many!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Apples, oranges, and berries</li>
        <li>Tomatoes (yes, they're actually fruits!)</li>
        <li>Cucumbers and peppers (these are fruits too!)</li>
        <li>Dragon fruit, apricots, and melons</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="fun-fact">
        <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Many vegetables we think of are actually fruits! If it has seeds inside, it's probably a fruit. Tomatoes, cucumbers, pumpkins, and peppers are all fruits!</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="activity">
        <p><strong>Think About It:</strong> How is a fruit protecting its seeds similar to how we protect things we care about? Think about how we use packaging to protect things that are fragile.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Remarkable Roots</h2>
    <p><span class="highlight">Roots</span> are the parts of plants that usually grow underground, where we can't see them. Roots have two very important jobs:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>They hold the plant firmly in the ground so it doesn't fall over</li>
        <li>They absorb (drink up) water and minerals from the soil that the plant needs to live</li>
    </ol>
    
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="roots_1.jpg" alt="Plant roots showing the network underground">
        <p class="image-caption">Roots form a network underground that anchors the plant and absorbs water and nutrients.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Roots often spread out under the ground, sometimes growing even wider than the plant is tall! This helps them find more water and hold the plant steady, even in strong winds.</p>
    
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="roots_2.jpg" alt="Close-up of plant roots showing fine root hairs">
        <p class="image-caption">Root systems can be complex with many small branches that help the plant absorb more water and nutrients.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p><strong>Roots we eat:</strong> Many delicious vegetables are actually roots:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Carrots</li>
        <li>Beets</li>
        <li>Radishes</li>
        <li>Sweet potatoes</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="fun-fact">
        <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Some plant roots can grow very deep! The roots of some desert plants can grow more than 60 meters (200 feet) deep to find water.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="activity">
        <p><strong>Think About It:</strong> How are plant roots similar to the foundation of a building? How do they both keep things stable?</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>How Plants Show They Are Alive</h2>
    <p>Plants are living things, just like animals and people. We can tell plants are alive because:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>They <span class="highlight">grow</span> bigger over time</li>
        <li>They need <span class="highlight">nutrients</span> (food and water) to stay healthy</li>
        <li>They <span class="highlight">reproduce</span> by making seeds for new plants</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Each external part of a plant has a special job that helps the plant stay alive and healthy. All these parts work together as a team!</p>
    
    <div class="activity">
        <p><strong>Think About It:</strong> How are plants similar to and different from animals in how they show they're alive?</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>How Plant Parts Work Together</h2>
    <p>All the external parts of a plant work together like a team to help the plant survive and grow:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Roots</strong> absorb water and minerals from the soil</li>
        <li><strong>Stems</strong> carry the water and minerals up to the leaves</li>
        <li><strong>Leaves</strong> use sunlight to make food for the plant</li>
        <li><strong>Flowers</strong> make seeds for new plants</li>
        <li><strong>Fruits</strong> protect the seeds and help them travel to new places</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="parts_of_plant.jpg" alt="Complete plant showing all parts working together">
        <p class="image-caption">All parts of the plant work together as a system - each with its own job but helping the whole plant survive.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>If any part doesn't do its job well, the whole plant might not be healthy. That's why each part is so important!</p>
    
    <div class="activity">
        <p><strong>Think About It:</strong> How is a plant with all its parts working together similar to a community where everyone has different jobs that help the whole community?</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>How We Learn From Plants</h2>
    <p>People often get ideas from plant parts to solve problems and make useful things:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Solar panels are designed like leaves to catch sunlight</li>
        <li>Strong buildings have foundations that work like roots</li>
        <li>Water pipes carry water like plant stems</li>
        <li>Protective packaging for fragile items works like fruits protecting seeds</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Scientists and engineers often look at how plant parts are shaped and how they work to get ideas for new inventions!</p>
    
    <div class="fun-fact">
        <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Velcro was invented after a scientist looked at how the tiny hooks on burdock seeds stuck to his dog's fur and his clothes. This is an example of learning from plants!</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Summary: The Amazing External Parts of Plants</h2>
    <p>Let's remember what we've learned about external plant parts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Stems</strong> - hold the plant up and carry water</li>
        <li><strong>Leaves</strong> - catch sunlight and make food</li>
        <li><strong>Flowers</strong> - make seeds and attract helpful animals</li>
        <li><strong>Fruits</strong> - protect seeds and help them travel</li>
        <li><strong>Roots</strong> - absorb water and hold the plant in place</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Plants are amazing living things with special parts that help them survive and grow. Each part has its own important job, and they all work together as a team!</p>
    
    <p>And remember - many of the foods we eat every day are actually these plant parts! Next time you eat a vegetable or fruit, try to figure out which part of the plant you're eating.</p>
    
    <div class="activity">
        <p><strong>Final Activity:</strong> Next time you eat a meal, try to identify which plant parts are on your plate. Are you eating roots, stems, leaves, flowers, or fruits?</p>
