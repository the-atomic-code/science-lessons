        <h1>Amazing Animal Parts: How Animals Use Their External Parts to Survive</h1>
        <h2>What Are External Animal Parts?</h2>
    <p>
        External parts of an animal are any parts found on the outside of its body. These include legs, tails, claws, skin, fur, feathers, scales, beaks, and shells. Animals use these special parts to help them survive in their environments.
    </p>
    
    <div class="fact-box">
        <p><strong>Did you know?</strong> Every external animal part has a specific job to help the animal stay alive. Some help animals move, others provide protection, and some help animals find food!</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Animal Legs: Built for Movement</h2>
    <p>
        Animals have different numbers of legs depending on what type of animal they are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Spiders</strong> have 8 legs</li>
        <li><strong>Insects</strong> like ants and butterflies have 6 legs</li>
        <li><strong>Mammals</strong> like dogs, cats, cows, lions, and bears have 4 legs</li>
        <li><strong>Birds</strong> have 2 legs</li>
        <li><strong>Snakes</strong> have no legs at all!</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="tarantula_spider.jpg" alt="Tarantula spider showing its 8 legs">
        <p class="image-caption">A tarantula spider has 8 legs, which help it move, climb, and capture prey. Notice how the legs are covered with tiny hairs that help the spider sense its surroundings.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>
        Animals use their legs to move in different ways - walking, running, jumping, climbing, and digging. A frog's powerful back legs help it jump far distances, while a dog's four legs help it run quickly. Having the right number and type of legs helps animals survive in their habitats.
    </p>
    
    <div class="activity">
        <h3>Think About It:</h3>
        <p>How would having 8 legs help a spider survive? How would it be different if a spider only had 4 legs like a dog?</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Claws: Tools for Survival</h2>
    <p>
        Many animals have claws at the ends of their toes or fingers. Claws are hard structures that serve multiple purposes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Digging for food (like the armadillo uses its strong claws to dig for insects)</li>
        <li>Building homes (like rabbits that dig burrows)</li>
        <li>Climbing trees (like cats and squirrels)</li>
        <li>Catching prey (like eagles and bears)</li>
        <li>Defending themselves from danger (like many animals use claws when threatened)</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="armadillo.jpg" alt="Armadillo using its strong claws to dig">
        <p class="image-caption">An armadillo uses its powerful claws to dig through soil in search of insects and grubs to eat. These claws are perfectly designed for digging through even hard ground.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>
        The shape and size of an animal's claws tell us a lot about how the animal lives. Animals that climb trees often have curved, sharp claws, while animals that dig have broader, stronger claws.
    </p>
    
    <div class="fun-fact">
        <p>The armadillo's claws are so powerful that they can break through hard soil and concrete!</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Amazing Animal Tails</h2>
    <p>
        Tails are another important external part for many animals. Different animals use their tails in different ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Monkeys</strong> use their tails to hang from trees, keeping their hands free to gather food or swing from branch to branch</li>
        <li><strong>Fish</strong> use their tails to swim through water</li>
        <li><strong>Dogs and cats</strong> use their tails for balance when running or walking</li>
        <li><strong>Lizards</strong> have a special ability to detach their tails when caught by predators, allowing them to escape while the predator is distracted by the still-moving tail</li>
        <li><strong>Horses and cows</strong> use their tails to swat away flies and insects</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="monkey_using_tail_to_hang_from_tree.jpg" alt="Monkey hanging from tree using its prehensile tail">
        <p class="image-caption">This monkey is using its strong, flexible tail to hang from a tree branch. Its hands remain free to gather food or help it move from branch to branch. This type of tail is called a prehensile tail.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>
        Tails come in many shapes and sizes depending on what job they need to do for the animal. Some are long and thin, others are short and bushy, and some are flat like a beaver's tail.
    </p>
    
    <div class="activity">
        <h3>Imagine:</h3>
        <p>If you had a tail, what kind would you want? How would it help you in your daily life?</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Animal Coverings: Protection for Every Environment</h2>
    <p>
        Animals have different types of coverings on their bodies that serve as protection:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Fur</strong> - Mammals like polar bears have thick fur that keeps them warm in cold environments</li>
        <li><strong>Feathers</strong> - Birds have feathers that help them fly, stay warm, and sometimes even stay dry in the rain</li>
        <li><strong>Scales</strong> - Fish and reptiles have scales that protect their bodies and help them move through their environments</li>
        <li><strong>Shells</strong> - Animals like turtles, crabs, and snails have hard shells that protect their soft body parts from predators</li>
        <li><strong>Skin</strong> - Animals like humans, elephants, and frogs have skin with special properties. Frog skin is special because it allows them to breathe through it!</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="cockatoo.jpg" alt="White cockatoo with feathers">
        <p class="image-caption">This cockatoo's feathers provide multiple benefits: they help the bird fly, keep it warm, and the bright coloring can help attract mates. The bird's beak is also an important external part used for eating and climbing.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>
        Some animal coverings have special patterns or colors that help them survive. For example, zebras have black and white striped patterns on their fur that help them blend in with other zebras in a herd, making it harder for predators like lions to single one out for an attack.
    </p>
    
    <div class="fact-box">
        <p><strong>Amazing fact:</strong> Frogs can breathe through their skin! Their skin allows oxygen to pass through directly into their bloodstream.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="crab.jpg" alt="Crab with protective shell and claws">
        <p class="image-caption">This crab's hard shell serves as armor to protect its body from predators. Its claws help it defend itself, catch food, and communicate with other crabs. The shell also provides support for the crab's body.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Special External Features</h2>
    
    <h3>Opposable Thumbs</h3>
    <p>
        Humans and other primates (like monkeys and apes) have a special feature called opposable thumbs. These thumbs can touch all the other fingers, making it possible to grip objects tightly. This helps with:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Grabbing and holding food</li>
        <li>Using tools</li>
        <li>Opening containers</li>
        <li>Climbing trees</li>
        <li>Using scissors and other tools</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Without opposable thumbs, many everyday tasks would be much harder!
    </p>
    
    <h3>Beaks</h3>
    <p>
        Birds have beaks instead of mouths with teeth. The shape of a bird's beak tells us what kind of food it eats:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Long, thin beaks help birds like hummingbirds drink nectar from flowers</li>
        <li>Short, strong beaks help birds like cardinals crack open seeds</li>
        <li>Hooked beaks help birds of prey like eagles tear meat</li>
        <li>Flat beaks help ducks filter food from water and mud</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="activity">
        <h3>Explore:</h3>
        <p>Look at different birds in your neighborhood. How do their beak shapes differ? What might this tell you about what they eat?</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>How External Parts Help Animals Survive</h2>
    <p>
        All these external parts work together to help animals:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Find and eat food</strong> - Like a bird's beak or an armadillo's claws</li>
        <li><strong>Move around</strong> - Like a fish's tail or a dog's legs</li>
        <li><strong>Stay safe from predators</strong> - Like a turtle's shell or a lizard's detachable tail</li>
        <li><strong>Stay comfortable in their environment</strong> - Like a polar bear's fur in cold weather</li>
        <li><strong>Find mates and have babies</strong> - Like the colorful feathers of many male birds</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="fact-box">
        <p>When an animal's external parts are well-suited to its environment, we say the animal is <span class="highlight">adapted</span> to its habitat.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Vocabulary to Know</h2>
    <div class="vocabulary">

        <h3>Final Challenge:</h3>
        <p>Look at all the animal pictures in this lesson. For each animal, identify at least two external parts and explain how these parts help the animal survive in its habitat. Then, can you think of a human invention that works similarly to one of these animal parts?</p>
