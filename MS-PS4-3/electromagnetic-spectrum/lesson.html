    <h1>The Electromagnetic Spectrum: Waves of Energy</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Introduction to Electromagnetic Waves</h2>
        <p>Electromagnetic radiation consists of waves that transfer energy without moving matter. Unlike water waves or sound waves that need a medium to travel through, electromagnetic waves can travel through empty space. These waves are created when charged particles move, and they can vary greatly in their properties and how they interact with matter.</p>
        
        <img src="wavelength_amplitude.jpg" alt="Diagram showing wavelength and amplitude of a wave">
        <div class="image-caption">Wave properties: Wavelength is the distance between wave peaks, while amplitude is the height of the wave from its resting position.</div>
        
        <div class="key-concept">
            <h3>Key Wave Characteristics</h3>
            <p><strong>Amplitude:</strong> The height of a wave from its resting point. Waves with larger amplitude transfer more energy.</p>
            <p><strong>Wavelength:</strong> The distance from one wave peak to the next peak. Measured in meters (m), nanometers (nm), or other length units.</p>
            <p><strong>Frequency:</strong> How many waves pass a point in one second, measured in Hertz (Hz). A frequency of 3 Hz means 3 waves pass a point every second.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>These characteristics are related. When wavelength is shorter, frequency is higher (more waves pass per second). The energy of electromagnetic waves is directly related to their frequency - higher frequency waves carry more energy than lower frequency waves.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>The Electromagnetic Spectrum Overview</h2>
        <p>The electromagnetic spectrum includes all possible wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation. While it's actually a continuous spectrum with no clear boundaries, scientists typically divide it into seven main sections based on wavelength and frequency:</p>

            <h3>Fun Fact!</h3>
            <p>All electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light in a vacuum (approximately 300,000,000 meters per second). This includes radio waves, visible light, and gamma rays, despite their huge differences in wavelength and energy!</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Radio Waves: The Long-Distance Travelers</h2>
        <p>Radio waves have the longest wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum, ranging from about 1 millimeter to 100 kilometers. Their low frequency gives them low energy compared to other electromagnetic waves, but they have unique properties that make them extremely useful.</p>

        <div class="image-caption">Cellular towers use radio waves to transmit signals for mobile communication over long distances.</div>
        
        <h3>Properties of Radio Waves</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Penetration ability:</strong> Radio waves can pass through walls and buildings, allowing wireless communication inside structures.</li>
            <li><strong>Long-distance travel:</strong> They can travel long distances without losing much energy.</li>
            <li><strong>Diffraction:</strong> They can bend around corners and obstacles better than higher frequency waves.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Applications of Radio Waves</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>AM and FM radio broadcasting</li>
            <li>Television signals</li>
            <li>WiFi networks</li>
            <li>Bluetooth connections</li>
            <li>Cell phone communications</li>
            <li>Radar systems</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="key-concept">
            <h3>Why Radio Waves Pass Through Walls</h3>
            <p>Radio waves can pass through non-metallic materials like wood, plaster, and concrete because their long wavelength makes them less likely to interact with the atoms in these materials. However, they can be blocked by materials containing free electrons, like metals. This is why special "Faraday cages" made of metal mesh can block radio signals.</p>

        <h2>Microwaves: Cooking and Communication</h2>
        <p>Microwaves have wavelengths ranging from about 1 millimeter to 1 meter, placing them between radio waves and infrared radiation on the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>
        
        <h3>Properties of Microwaves</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Higher frequency and energy than radio waves</li>
            <li>Can penetrate clouds, light rain, and snow, but not solid objects</li>
            <li>Strongly absorbed by water molecules</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="key-concept">
            <h3>How Microwave Ovens Work</h3>
            <p>Microwave ovens use electromagnetic waves with a specific frequency (usually 2.45 GHz) that causes water molecules in food to vibrate rapidly. The friction between these vibrating molecules generates heat, which cooks the food. This is why foods with high water content heat up quickly, while dry items like ceramics or plastics don't absorb much energy.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Infrared Waves: Heat Signatures</h2>
        <p>Infrared waves have wavelengths between 750 nanometers and 1 millimeter, falling between visible light and microwaves on the spectrum. The word "infrared" means "below red," as these waves have longer wavelengths than red light (the longest wavelength of visible light).</p>

        <div class="image-caption">Thermal imaging uses infrared detection to create a visual representation of temperature differences, showing warmer areas in brighter colors.</div>
        
        <h3>Properties of Infrared Waves</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>All objects with a temperature above absolute zero emit infrared radiation</li>
            <li>The hotter an object, the more infrared energy it emits</li>
            <li>Strongly absorbed by water and most organic molecules</li>
            <li>Cannot penetrate very far through fog or clouds</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="key-concept">
            <h3>Thermal Imaging</h3>
            <p>Thermal imaging cameras detect infrared radiation emitted by objects and convert this information into a visible image. Areas emitting more infrared energy (warmer objects) appear as brighter or different colors than cooler areas. This technology allows us to "see" heat patterns that are invisible to the naked eye, making it useful for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Finding people in smoke-filled buildings or darkness</li>
                <li>Detecting heat leaks in buildings</li>
                <li>Medical diagnoses (identifying inflammation)</li>
                <li>Night vision for military and security applications</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Remote controls for TVs and other devices</li>
            <li>Thermal imaging cameras</li>

        <h2>Visible Light: The Colors We See</h2>
        <p>Visible light is the only part of the electromagnetic spectrum that human eyes can detect. It covers wavelengths from approximately 400 to 700 nanometers (0.0000004 to 0.0000007 meters).</p>
        
        <img src="light-reflected-transmitted-absorbed.jpg" alt="Diagram showing how light can be reflected, transmitted, or absorbed by materials">
        <div class="image-caption">Light interacts with matter in three primary ways: it can be reflected, transmitted (pass through), or absorbed by different materials.</div>
        
        <h3>The Visible Spectrum</h3>
        <p>What we perceive as white light is actually a combination of all wavelengths of visible light. When light passes through a prism, these wavelengths separate to form a rainbow of colors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Red:</strong> 620-750 nm (longest wavelength, lowest energy)</li>
            <li><strong>Orange:</strong> 590-620 nm</li>
            <li><strong>Yellow:</strong> 570-590 nm</li>
            <li><strong>Green:</strong> 495-570 nm</li>
            <li><strong>Blue:</strong> 450-495 nm</li>
            <li><strong>Indigo:</strong> 425-450 nm</li>
            <li><strong>Violet:</strong> 380-425 nm (shortest wavelength, highest energy)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="key-concept">
            <h3>Rainbows and Prisms</h3>
            <p>Both rainbows and prisms demonstrate how white light can be separated into its component colors. This happens because different wavelengths of light travel at different speeds through materials like water or glass, causing them to bend (refract) at different angles. This phenomenon is called dispersion.</p>
            <p>In a rainbow, sunlight enters water droplets in the air, reflects off the back of the droplets, and exits at different angles based on wavelength, creating the colorful arc we see in the sky.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="fun-fact">
            <h3>Fun Fact!</h3>
            <p>Some animals can see beyond the human visible spectrum. Bees and many birds can see into the ultraviolet range, while some snakes can detect infrared radiation, allowing them to "see" the heat signatures of their prey even in complete darkness!</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Ultraviolet Light: Beyond Violet</h2>
        <p>Ultraviolet (UV) light has wavelengths shorter than visible light, ranging from about 10 to 400 nanometers. "Ultraviolet" means "beyond violet," as these waves have shorter wavelengths than violet light (the shortest wavelength of visible light).</p>
        
        <h3>Properties of UV Radiation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Higher energy than visible light</li>
            <li>Can cause chemical reactions</li>
            <li>Can damage living cells and DNA</li>
            <li>Some materials fluoresce (glow) when exposed to UV light</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Applications of UV Light</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Sterilization and disinfection (kills bacteria and viruses)</li>
            <li>Detecting counterfeit currency and documents</li>
            <li>Black lights for special effects</li>
            <li>Curing certain adhesives and coatings</li>
            <li>Medical treatments for skin conditions</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="key-concept">
            <h3>UV and Sun Protection</h3>
            <p>The Sun produces all types of electromagnetic radiation, including ultraviolet light. Earth's atmosphere filters out most of the harmful UV radiation, but enough still reaches the surface to cause sunburn, skin aging, and even skin cancer with prolonged exposure. Sunscreen works by absorbing or reflecting UV radiation before it can damage skin cells. This is why using sunscreen with adequate SPF (Sun Protection Factor) is important for skin health.</p>

        <h2>X-Rays: Seeing Inside</h2>
        <p>X-rays have wavelengths ranging from about 0.01 to 10 nanometers, making them much shorter than ultraviolet light. They were discovered in 1895 by Wilhelm Röntgen, who named them "X-rays" because they were an unknown type of radiation at the time.</p>
        
        <img src="x-ray_of_hands.jpg" alt="X-ray image of human hands">
        <div class="image-caption">X-ray image showing the bones of human hands. The dense bone tissue absorbs X-rays while soft tissue allows them to pass through, creating the contrast in the image.</div>
        
        <h3>Properties of X-Rays</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>High frequency and energy</li>
            <li>Can penetrate many materials that block visible light</li>
            <li>Different materials absorb X-rays to different degrees</li>
            <li>Can ionize atoms (knock electrons off atoms), making them potentially harmful to living tissue</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="key-concept">
            <h3>Medical X-Ray Imaging</h3>
            <p>X-rays pass easily through soft tissues like skin and muscle but are absorbed by denser materials like bone. This differential absorption is what makes X-ray imaging possible:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>When X-rays pass through the body, bones absorb more radiation than surrounding tissues</li>
                <li>The X-rays that pass through hit a detector (traditionally film, now usually digital sensors)</li>
                <li>Areas where X-rays were absorbed (like bones) appear white on the final image</li>
                <li>Areas where X-rays passed through (like soft tissue) appear darker</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This technology allows doctors to see bone fractures, dental cavities, pneumonia, and other conditions without surgery.</p>

            <h3>Why High-Frequency Waves Carry More Energy</h3>
            <p>The energy of an electromagnetic wave is directly proportional to its frequency. This means gamma rays with extremely high frequencies carry much more energy than low-frequency radio waves. This higher energy makes gamma rays more capable of ionizing atoms (removing electrons), which is why they're more dangerous to living tissues. It also explains why they can penetrate materials that block other types of radiation.</p>
