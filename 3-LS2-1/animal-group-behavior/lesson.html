            <h2>What is Animal Group Behavior?</h2>
            <p>
                Group behavior is what animals do with other animals to help them survive. Animals come together in groups that can be large, like a herd of a million wildebeest, or small, like a pride of a few lions. Even humans live in groups and work together to help one another. The main purpose of group behavior is to help living things survive.

            <h2>Defense Through Group Behavior</h2>
            <p>
                One of the main reasons animals form groups is to defend themselves. When there are more individuals in the group, there are more pairs of eyes to look out for danger. Many animals have developed special defense behaviors that work because they live in groups.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Meerkat Sentries</h3>
            <p>
                Meerkats have an amazing defense system! They take turns standing as "sentries" or lookouts for the group. The sentry meerkat stands up on its hind legs to look around for predators, especially big birds that might attack from above. If the sentry spots danger, it makes an alarm call to alert the entire group. The other meerkats then quickly run to their burrows to hide.
            </p>
            
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="meerkat_on_alert.jpg" alt="Meerkat standing on alert">
                <p class="caption">A meerkat stands on its hind legs acting as a sentry for its group</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>
                Meerkats have several advantages that help them stay safe:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Light-colored fur that blends in with the sand of the African savannah</li>
                <li>Complex burrow systems with multiple rooms, entry points, and exits</li>
                <li>Taking turns as lookouts so everyone can eat and rest safely</li>
                <li>Different alarm calls for different types of predators</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Fish Schools</h3>
            <p>
                Did you know that 80% of all known fish species swim in schools? A school of fish is a large group of fish swimming together in the same direction. When predators approach, the school moves together like one giant organism, making it hard for predators to single out individual fish. This confuses the predator and makes it difficult to catch any single fish.
            </p>

                <p class="caption">A school of barracuda fish swimming in tight formation for protection</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Wildebeest and Zebra Partnership</h3>
            <p>
                Wildebeest have a clever defense strategy - they stay close to zebras! Scientists believe that wildebeest hang out with zebras in hopes that when a predator attacks, it might catch a zebra instead of a wildebeest. But this relationship benefits zebras too - wildebeest are better at smelling danger while zebras have better eyesight. Together, they can detect predators more effectively than either species could alone.
            </p>
            <p>
                When a predator gets near a wildebeest herd, they make an alarm call to signal the other members of the herd. Traveling in massive herds during the great migration provides safety in numbers when crossing dangerous territories.
            </p>
            
            <div class="activity">
                <strong>Try This Activity:</strong> With friends or family members, try playing a defense game. Have one person be the "predator" and the others be a "herd" of animals. See how much harder it is for the "predator" to tag someone when you stay together versus when you're separated!

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Working Together to Find Food</h2>
            <p>
                Another important reason animals form groups is to help each other find and gather food. Different animals have developed amazing ways to work together to make sure everyone in the group gets enough to eat.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Honey Bee Waggle Dance</h3>
            <p>
                Honey bees have an incredible way of communicating about food sources - they dance! When a worker bee finds flowers with lots of nectar, it returns to the hive and performs a special "waggle dance." This dance tells the other bees:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Which direction to fly (based on the angle of the dance)</li>
                <li>How far to fly (based on how long the bee waggles)</li>
                <li>How good the food source is (based on how enthusiastically it dances)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="bees_in_flight.jpg" alt="Honey bees flying near their hive">
                <p class="caption">Honey bees returning to their hive after collecting nectar</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>
                Worker bees are the most plentiful bees in a colony. When they return to the hive, they share the collected nectar with other bees and feed the bee larvae (baby bees). The entire colony depends on this teamwork to survive.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Wolf Pack Hunting</h3>
            <p>
                Wolf packs (5-11 wolves) hunt together using teamwork. Some wolves might chase prey toward other pack members waiting in ambush. This coordination allows wolves to catch animals that would be too large or fast for a single wolf to catch alone. After a successful hunt, the wolves share the meal with the entire pack.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Leaf Cutter Ants</h3>
            <p>
                Leaf cutter ants have an amazing food system! These ants chop leaves and carry them back to their colony. But they don't eat the leaves directly - instead, they use the leaves as fertilizer to grow fungus, which becomes food for the entire colony. Different ants have different jobs:
            </p>
            
            <div class="image-container">

            </div>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Some cut the leaves into pieces</li>
                <li>Others carry the leaf pieces back to the nest</li>
                <li>Some tend to the fungus garden</li>
                <li>Others protect the colony</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Without this teamwork and division of labor, the colony couldn't survive.

            <h2>Saving Energy Through Group Movement</h2>
            <p>
                Some animals form groups specifically for movement. By moving together in certain formations, animals can save energy and travel farther.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Birds Flying in V-Formation</h3>
            <p>
                Have you ever seen geese or other migrating birds flying in a V-shape? This formation helps birds conserve energy during long flights. Each bird flies slightly above and behind the one in front of it, which creates an updraft that makes flying easier. Scientists have discovered that birds flying in V-formation use up to 70% less energy than birds flying alone!
            </p>
            
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="birds_flying_formation.jpg" alt="Birds flying in V-formation">

            </div>
            
            <p>
                The birds take turns being at the front of the V, where flying is hardest. When the lead bird gets tired, it moves back and another bird takes the lead position. This rotation ensures that no single bird gets too exhausted.
            </p>
            
            <h3>The Great Wildebeest Migration</h3>
            <p>
                The great migration involves millions of wildebeest traveling in a circular route of 500 miles between the Serengeti in Tanzania to grasslands in Kenya. They follow the rains in search of fresh grass to eat. By traveling in enormous herds, wildebeest gain several advantages:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Protection from predators through sheer numbers</li>
                <li>Shared knowledge of migration routes</li>
                <li>Help crossing dangerous rivers where predators wait</li>
                <li>Trampling of grass that stimulates new growth for return journeys</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="fun-fact">
                <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> During river crossings in the great migration, some wildebeest get taken by crocodiles. However, the chance of any individual wildebeest being caught is very small because there are so many animals crossing at once - this is a clear example of safety in numbers!

            <h2>Finding Mates in Groups</h2>
            <p>
                Living in groups makes it much easier for animals to find mates without having to travel far from safety. This increases their chances of successfully reproducing while staying protected from predators.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Flamingo Colonies</h3>
            <p>
                Flamingos form colonies that can range from 50 individuals to thousands of members. They typically gather in these large groups because they all eat the same specialized food - algae and brine shrimp that give them their pink color.
            </p>

            </div>
            
            <p>
                One major benefit of living together in these colonies is that flamingos don't need to travel far to find mates. If they had to search far and wide for other flamingos, they would be more vulnerable to predators like alligators and crocodiles. The colony provides both safety and convenient mate-finding!

                Some animals share the responsibility of raising and protecting their young. This group care gives babies a better chance of survival.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Meerkat Baby Care</h3>
            <p>
                In a meerkat mob, all the members help take care of the babies. While some adults hunt for food, others act as babysitters. These "helpers" will:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Protect the babies from predators</li>
                <li>Keep them warm</li>
                <li>Teach them important survival skills</li>
                <li>Share food with them</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This cooperative baby care means more babies survive to adulthood, which helps the entire group thrive.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Bee Larvae Care</h3>
            <p>
                In a honey bee colony, worker bees share the job of feeding and caring for the bee larvae (baby bees). Some workers prepare special food called "royal jelly" and "bee bread" to feed the growing larvae. Others maintain the perfect temperature in the hive for the larvae to develop properly. This shared responsibility ensures the next generation of bees will grow up healthy.

            <h2>Mixed-Species Groups</h2>
            <p>
                Sometimes different species of animals form groups together! This happens when both species can benefit from each other's unique abilities.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Wildebeest and Zebras</h3>
            <p>
                Wildebeest and zebras often travel together during migration. This partnership works because:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Zebras have excellent eyesight and can spot predators from far away</li>
                <li>Wildebeest have a strong sense of smell and can detect predators even when they can't see them</li>
                <li>Zebras eat the taller grass, revealing the shorter grass that wildebeest prefer</li>
                <li>Together, they create confusion for predators who must choose which animal to chase</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This is a mutually beneficial relationship where both species have a better chance of survival by staying together than they would alone.

            <h2>Let's Review!</h2>
            <p>Here are the key points about animal group behavior:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Animal groups can be small (like wolf packs with 5-11 members) or very large (like wildebeest herds with over a million animals).</li>
                <li>The main reasons animals form groups are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Defense against predators</li>
                        <li>Help finding and gathering food</li>
                        <li>Energy conservation during movement</li>
                        <li>Finding mates safely</li>
                        <li>Caring for young together</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Meerkats use sentries to watch for danger and alert the group with alarm calls.</li>
                <li>Honey bees communicate through waggle dances to share information about food sources.</li>
                <li>Leaf cutter ants divide labor within their colony to grow fungus for food.</li>
                <li>Migrating birds fly in V-formation to save energy during long flights.</li>
                <li>Fish swim in schools to confuse predators and make it harder to be caught.</li>
                <li>Wildebeest travel with zebras for mutual protection, using the zebras' good eyesight and their own good sense of smell.</li>
                <li>Flamingos form colonies near specialized food sources, which also makes finding mates easier.</li>
                <li>Group behaviors have evolved because they help individual animals survive better than they would alone.</li>
