            <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The sun radiates enormous amounts of energy as light and heat.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Plants capture this solar energy through their leaves using a process called <span class="vocab-term">photosynthesis</span>.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Plants convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into sugar (food) and oxygen.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> This stored energy in plants becomes available to all other living things!</p>

            <h3>What Makes Plants So Special?</h3>
            <p>Plants are called <span class="vocab-term">producers</span> because they are the only living things that can make their own food! They don't need to eat other organisms - they create their own energy-rich food using:</p>

            <h3>üå≥ Real-World Example</h3>
            <p>A mighty oak tree starts as a tiny acorn. As it grows into a massive tree, where does all that wood, bark, and leaves come from? Most people think it comes from the soil, but amazingly, most of the tree's mass actually comes from carbon dioxide in the air, powered by energy from the sun!</p>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h3>Why Animals Need to Eat</h3>
            <p>Unlike plants, animals are <span class="vocab-term">consumers</span> because they cannot make their own food. They must consume (eat) other living things to get energy and building materials for their bodies.</p>
            
            <h4>What Do Animals Use Food Energy For?</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>üèÉ <strong>Movement:</strong> Running, swimming, flying, or walking</li>
                <li>üå°Ô∏è <strong>Body warmth:</strong> Maintaining proper body temperature</li>

            <p><strong>üå± Herbivores (Primary Consumers):</strong> Animals that eat only plants</p>
            <ul><li>Examples: Rabbits, deer, zebras, elephants, many insects</li></ul>
            
            <p><strong>ü•© Carnivores (Secondary/Tertiary Consumers):</strong> Animals that eat other animals</p>

                <li>Grass captures sun energy through photosynthesis</li>
                <li>Rabbit eats grass and gets that stored energy</li>

        <div class="energy-flow">
            <h3>Why Food Chains Are Usually Short</h3>
            <p>Most food chains have only 4-5 steps. Why? Because <span class="highlight">energy is lost at each step!</span></p>
            
            <p><strong>The Energy Loss Rule:</strong> Every time one animal eats another, about 90% of the energy is "lost" as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>üî• Heat energy (keeping the animal warm)</li>
                <li>üèÉ Movement energy (running, breathing, pumping blood)</li>
                <li>üóëÔ∏è Waste products (what the body can't use)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Only about 10% of the energy gets stored in the animal's body for the next consumer to use!</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="activity">
            <h3>üéØ Energy Transfer Challenge</h3>
            <p><strong>Imagine this scenario:</strong> A sunflower captures 1000 units of energy from the sun. A mouse eats the sunflower seeds and gets 100 units. A snake eats the mouse and gets 10 units. A hawk eats the snake and gets 1 unit.</p>
            <p><strong>See the pattern?</strong> Each step keeps only 10% of the energy from the previous step. This is why there can't be too many steps in a food chain - there wouldn't be enough energy left!</p>

            <h3>Life is More Complex Than Simple Chains</h3>
            <p>In real life, most animals eat many different things, and most animals are eaten by several different predators. A <span class="vocab-term">food web</span> shows all these interconnected feeding relationships - it's like a map of who eats whom in nature!</p>

                <li><strong>Energy source:</strong> All the plant energy originally came from the sun!</li>

        <div class="interactive-note">
            <strong>Arrows in Food Webs:</strong> The arrows always point in the direction energy flows. So an arrow from grass to a zebra means "energy flows from grass to zebra when the zebra eats the grass."
