            <h3>Where Does All Energy Come From?</h3>
            <p>Every single bit of energy that powers life on Earth comes from one amazing source: <span class="highlight">the sun!</span> Think about it - when you run, jump, or even just sit and think, the energy your body is using originally came from sunlight millions of miles away.</p>

            <h3>The Solar Energy Journey</h3>
            <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The sun radiates enormous amounts of energy as light and heat.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Plants capture this solar energy through their leaves using a process called <span class="vocab-term">photosynthesis</span>.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Plants convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into sugar (food) and oxygen.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> This stored energy in plants becomes available to all other living things!</p>

        <h2>🌿 Producers: The Energy Makers</h2>
        <div class="concept-box">
            <h3>What Makes Plants So Special?</h3>
            <p>Plants are called <span class="vocab-term">producers</span> because they are the only living things that can make their own food! They don't need to eat other organisms - they create their own energy-rich food using:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>🌞 <strong>Sunlight</strong> - The energy source</li>
                <li>💧 <strong>Water</strong> - Absorbed through roots</li>
                <li>🌬️ <strong>Carbon dioxide</strong> - Taken from the air</li>
                <li>🍃 <strong>Chlorophyll</strong> - The green chemical that captures light</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example-box">
            <h3>🌳 Real-World Example</h3>
            <p>A mighty oak tree starts as a tiny acorn. As it grows into a massive tree, where does all that wood, bark, and leaves come from? Most people think it comes from the soil, but amazingly, most of the tree's mass actually comes from carbon dioxide in the air, powered by energy from the sun!</p>

        <div class="interactive-note">
            <strong>Think About This:</strong> Right now, as you read this, plants all around the world are busy capturing sunlight and turning it into food. Every leaf is like a tiny solar panel working to power the entire web of life!

        <h2>🐰 Consumers: The Energy Users</h2>
        <div class="concept-box">
            <h3>Why Animals Need to Eat</h3>
            <p>Unlike plants, animals are <span class="vocab-term">consumers</span> because they cannot make their own food. They must consume (eat) other living things to get energy and building materials for their bodies.</p>
            
            <h4>What Do Animals Use Food Energy For?</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>🏃 <strong>Movement:</strong> Running, swimming, flying, or walking</li>
                <li>🌡️ <strong>Body warmth:</strong> Maintaining proper body temperature</li>
                <li>💪 <strong>Growth:</strong> Building new muscles, bones, and tissues</li>
                <li>🩹 <strong>Repair:</strong> Healing cuts, growing new fur, or replacing old cells</li>
                <li>🧠 <strong>Thinking:</strong> Powering the brain and nervous system</li>
                <li>❤️ <strong>Life functions:</strong> Breathing, heartbeat, and digestion</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="energy-flow">
            <h3>Types of Consumers</h3>
            <p><strong>🌱 Herbivores (Primary Consumers):</strong> Animals that eat only plants</p>
            <ul><li>Examples: Rabbits, deer, zebras, elephants, many insects</li></ul>
            
            <p><strong>🥩 Carnivores (Secondary/Tertiary Consumers):</strong> Animals that eat other animals</p>
            <ul><li>Examples: Lions, wolves, hawks, sharks, snakes</li></ul>
            
            <p><strong>🍽️ Omnivores:</strong> Animals that eat both plants and animals</p>
            <ul><li>Examples: Bears, humans, pigs, raccoons</li></ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example-box">
            <h3>🔥 Energy in Action</h3>
            <p>Did you know that right now, as you sit reading this, your body is burning food energy to keep you warm? You're literally like a gentle fire, constantly converting food into heat energy. That's why you need to eat regularly - you're always using up energy!</p>

            <h3>Following a Single Path</h3>
            <p>A <span class="vocab-term">food chain</span> shows a simple, straight-line path of who eats whom. It's like following a single trail of energy through nature.</p>

            </div>
            
            <div class="energy-chain">
                🌱 Grass <span class="arrow">→</span> 🐰 Rabbit <span class="arrow">→</span> 🦊 Fox <span class="arrow">→</span> 🦅 Eagle
            </div>
            
            <p>In this chain:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Grass captures sun energy through photosynthesis</li>
                <li>Rabbit eats grass and gets that stored energy</li>
                <li>Fox eats rabbit and receives the energy</li>
                <li>Eagle eats fox and gets the energy passed along</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="energy-flow">
            <h3>Why Food Chains Are Usually Short</h3>
            <p>Most food chains have only 4-5 steps. Why? Because <span class="highlight">energy is lost at each step!</span></p>
            
            <p><strong>The Energy Loss Rule:</strong> Every time one animal eats another, about 90% of the energy is "lost" as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>🔥 Heat energy (keeping the animal warm)</li>
                <li>🏃 Movement energy (running, breathing, pumping blood)</li>
                <li>🗑️ Waste products (what the body can't use)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Only about 10% of the energy gets stored in the animal's body for the next consumer to use!</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="activity">
            <h3>🎯 Energy Transfer Challenge</h3>
            <p><strong>Imagine this scenario:</strong> A sunflower captures 1000 units of energy from the sun. A mouse eats the sunflower seeds and gets 100 units. A snake eats the mouse and gets 10 units. A hawk eats the snake and gets 1 unit.</p>
            <p><strong>See the pattern?</strong> Each step keeps only 10% of the energy from the previous step. This is why there can't be too many steps in a food chain - there wouldn't be enough energy left!</p>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h3>Life is More Complex Than Simple Chains</h3>
            <p>In real life, most animals eat many different things, and most animals are eaten by several different predators. A <span class="vocab-term">food web</span> shows all these interconnected feeding relationships - it's like a map of who eats whom in nature!</p>

            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example-box">
            <h3>🦓 African Savanna Example</h3>
            <p>Think about a zebra in Africa:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What it eats:</strong> Grass, leaves, bark from acacia trees</li>
                <li><strong>What eats it:</strong> Lions, cheetahs, hyenas, wild dogs</li>
                <li><strong>Competition:</strong> Shares food with giraffes, elephants, wildebeest</li>
                <li><strong>Energy source:</strong> All the plant energy originally came from the sun!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This creates a complex web of relationships, not just a simple chain.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="interactive-note">
            <strong>Arrows in Food Webs:</strong> The arrows always point in the direction energy flows. So an arrow from grass to a zebra means "energy flows from grass to zebra when the zebra eats the grass."

            <h3>Why Apex Predators Need So Much Space</h3>
