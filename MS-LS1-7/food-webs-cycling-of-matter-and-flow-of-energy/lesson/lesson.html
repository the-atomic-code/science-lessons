        <h1>Food Webs: Cycling of Matter and Flow of Energy</h1>
        <div class="section">
        <h2>Introduction to Ecosystems</h2>
        <p>Every ecosystem is made up of a variety of living and nonliving things. The living things within an ecosystem depend on each other to obtain their energy and matter. In this lesson, we'll explore how energy flows through ecosystems and how matter cycles within them.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Key Term:</strong> An <strong>ecosystem</strong> is a system of living and nonliving things in a particular area or environment that interact with each other.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Food Chains and Food Webs</h2>
        <p>A simple diagram called a <strong>food chain</strong> represents how energy flows in an ecosystem. A food chain starts with <strong>producers</strong> (plants) at the bottom. Next, a first order consumer (herbivore) eats the plants to obtain energy. Next in the chain is the second order consumer (carnivore), followed by a tertiary consumer (top predator).</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="food_chain.jpg" alt="A simple food chain showing energy flow from plants to higher-level consumers">
            <p class="caption">A food chain showing the flow of energy from producers (plants) through primary, secondary, and tertiary consumers.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Food chains typically have 4 levels, though this can vary. Here's a simple example:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Producer (grass)</li>
            <li>Primary Consumer (rabbit)</li>
            <li>Secondary Consumer (fox)</li>
            <li>Tertiary Consumer (hawk)</li>
        </ol>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <p>A <strong>food web</strong> is the overlapping of multiple food chains within an ecosystem. Living things don't eat the same thing all the time. Just like people, animals like variety in their diets. This results in living things eating from multiple food chains, which creates a food web.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>For example, bears consume plants (acting as primary consumers), but also consume fish (acting as secondary or tertiary consumers). This flexibility creates complex food webs in ecosystems.</p>
        
        <div class="check-understanding">
            <p><strong>Think About It:</strong> Why are food webs more realistic representations of feeding relationships in ecosystems than simple food chains?</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Producers: The Foundation of Food Chains</h2>
        <p>Producers are organisms that make their own food through a process called <strong>photosynthesis</strong>. Plants, algae, and some bacteria are producers.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Photosynthesis:</h3>
            <p>This chemical process uses energy from the sun to turn carbon dioxide and water into sugar and oxygen.</p>
            <p>The chemical equation for photosynthesis is:</p>
            <p class="important">Carbon Dioxide + Water + Sunlight → Glucose (Sugar) + Oxygen</p>
            <p>6CO<sub>2</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>O + light energy → C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 6O<sub>2</sub></p>
        </div>
        
        <p>During photosynthesis, plants capture the sun's energy and store it in the chemical bonds of glucose molecules. This conversion of light energy to chemical energy is fundamental to nearly all life on Earth.</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="FoodWeb_Photosynthesis_Respiration_Connection.jpg" alt="Connection between photosynthesis and respiration in food webs">
            <p class="caption">Food webs rely on the complementary processes of photosynthesis (in plants) and cellular respiration (in all organisms).</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="check-understanding">
            <p><strong>Think About It:</strong> Why can plants make their own food while animals cannot? What special structures do plants have that allow them to perform photosynthesis?</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Consumers: Getting Energy Second-Hand</h2>
        <p><strong>Consumers</strong> are living things that eat other living things to obtain energy. They cannot make their own food.</p>

        <p>When consumers eat food, their bodies break down the food molecules through digestion and cellular respiration to extract energy and useful building blocks.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Cellular Respiration: How Organisms Release Energy from Food</h2>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Cellular Respiration:</h3>
            <p>This chemical process takes place in the cells of all living things. It breaks down glucose (sugar) using oxygen to release energy that cells can use.</p>
            <p>The chemical equation for cellular respiration is:</p>
            <p class="important">Glucose (Sugar) + Oxygen → Carbon Dioxide + Water + Energy</p>
            <p>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 6O<sub>2</sub> → 6CO<sub>2</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>O + Energy</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Notice that cellular respiration is essentially the reverse of photosynthesis. The products of photosynthesis (glucose and oxygen) become the reactants in cellular respiration, and the products of cellular respiration (carbon dioxide and water) are the reactants in photosynthesis.</p>

            <p><strong>Think About It:</strong> Why do organisms need both food AND oxygen for cellular respiration? What would happen if either was missing?</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Energy Flow Through Ecosystems</h2>
        <p>All ecosystems start with energy from the sun. Without sunlight, plants cannot undergo photosynthesis. Using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide, plants make sugar and release oxygen.</p>
        
        <p>When a consumer eats a plant, it gains some energy from these sugars. When the next consumer in the food chain eats the first consumer, energy is passed from one consumer to the next.</p>
        
        <div class="energy-pyramid">
            <h3>The Energy Pyramid</h3>
            <p>The amount of energy decreases with each level of the food chain. Only about 10% of the energy from one level is transferred to the next level. The rest is lost as heat during the organism's life processes.</p>
            
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="EcologicalEnergyPyramid_TrophicLevels.jpg" alt="Ecological energy pyramid showing decreasing energy at higher trophic levels">
                <p class="caption">The ecological energy pyramid shows how energy decreases at each trophic level. Only about 10% of energy transfers to the next level, with the rest being lost as heat.</p>
            </div>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Producers (Base of pyramid): 100% of available energy</li>
                <li>Primary Consumers: About 10% of producer energy</li>
                <li>Secondary Consumers: About 1% of producer energy</li>
                <li>Tertiary Consumers (Top of pyramid): About 0.1% of producer energy</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>Since the amount of energy decreases with each level of the food chain, ecosystems can only support smaller numbers of consumers as you go up the food chain. At the top of a food chain, there might only be one hawk. At the bottom of the food chain, there would be many plants.</p>
        
        <div class="check-understanding">
            <p><strong>Think About It:</strong> Why does an ecosystem's energy pyramid get smaller at each level? Where does the "missing" energy go?</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Decomposers: Nature's Recyclers</h2>
        <p><strong>Decomposers</strong> are organisms such as fungi, bacteria, worms, or maggots that break down dead organic matter. This is crucial to the cycling of matter in an ecosystem.</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">

        </div>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <p>As decomposers feed on dead animals and plants, they break down the complex molecules into simpler substances like carbon dioxide and water molecules that go back into the soil. The amount of matter in an ecosystem never changes; it just cycles through the ecosystem in different forms.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="Decomposers_Breaking_Down_Organic_Matter.jpg" alt="Close-up view of decomposers breaking down organic matter">
            <p class="caption">Decomposers breaking down dead organic matter, returning essential nutrients to the soil.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Without decomposers, dead organisms and waste would pile up, and the nutrients within them would remain locked up and unavailable for future generations of living things.</p>
        
        <div class="check-understanding">
            <p><strong>Think About It:</strong> When living things die, why are there only bones remaining after some time? What happens to all the other matter?</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Conservation of Matter in Ecosystems</h2>
        <p>A fundamental principle in science is that <strong>matter is neither created nor destroyed</strong> in ordinary chemical reactions; it is only rearranged. This applies to ecosystems too!</p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Cycling of Matter:</h3>
            <p>The same atoms that make up your body today have been cycling through Earth's ecosystems for billions of years. They may have been part of a dinosaur, a tree, or countless other organisms throughout history.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>When you eat food, the atoms in that food become part of your body. Your body breaks down the food molecules through digestion and reassembles the atoms into molecules that make up your cells and tissues.</p>
        
        <p>For example, when you eat a hamburger:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Digestion breaks down the proteins in the meat into amino acids</li>
            <li>Your body absorbs these amino acids</li>
            <li>Your cells use these amino acids to build new proteins for your muscles and other tissues</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>The atoms themselves don't change – they're just rearranged into different molecules.</p>
        
        <div class="check-understanding">
            <p><strong>Think About It:</strong> How are atoms conserved when a hawk digests a mouse? Are any atoms created or destroyed in this process?</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Food Provides Both Matter and Energy</h2>
        <p>Food serves two crucial purposes for living organisms:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Source of matter:</strong> The atoms and molecules in food become part of your body</li>
            <li><strong>Source of energy:</strong> Breaking the chemical bonds in food molecules releases energy that powers life processes</li>
        </ol>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <p>Remember: Energy flows through an ecosystem (sun → producers → consumers) and is eventually lost as heat, while matter cycles within an ecosystem (producers → consumers → decomposers → back to soil).</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Bioaccumulation in Food Chains</h2>
        <p>Sometimes harmful substances like pesticides, heavy metals (such as mercury), or other pollutants can enter food chains. When this happens, these substances can become more concentrated at higher trophic levels in a process called <strong>bioaccumulation</strong>.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Example: Mercury in Marine Food Chains</h3>
            <p>Mercury from industrial pollution can enter water bodies and be absorbed by tiny organisms. Small fish eat many of these tiny organisms, accumulating the mercury in their tissues. Larger fish eat many small fish, further concentrating the mercury. When humans or other top predators consume these larger fish, they may ingest dangerous levels of mercury.</p>

        </div>
        
        <p>This is why marine biologists study food chains within ocean ecosystems. Their research helps us understand which fish might contain higher levels of harmful substances like mercury, allowing us to make safer choices about the fish we eat.</p>
        
        <div class="check-understanding">
            <p><strong>Think About It:</strong> Why do larger, predatory fish like tuna and swordfish often contain higher levels of mercury than smaller fish like sardines?</p>

        <h2>Summary: The Big Ideas</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Energy flows through ecosystems in one direction, starting with the sun</li>
            <li>Matter cycles within ecosystems and is never created or destroyed</li>
            <li>Producers make their own food through photosynthesis</li>
            <li>Consumers get energy by eating other organisms</li>
            <li>Decomposers break down dead matter, returning nutrients to the soil</li>
            <li>Only about 10% of energy transfers to the next trophic level</li>
            <li>Food provides both matter (building blocks) and energy for organisms</li>
            <li>Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are complementary processes</li>
