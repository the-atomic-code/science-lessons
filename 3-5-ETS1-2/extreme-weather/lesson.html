        <h1>Extreme Weather and Engineering Solutions</h1>
        
        <h2>What is Extreme Weather?</h2>
        <p>Extreme weather refers to any weather that falls outside of normal patterns. This includes heavy winds, thunderstorms, floods, heat waves, tornados, hurricanes, hail, and blizzards. These weather events can cause significant damage to homes, buildings, and infrastructure.</p>
        
        <img src="hurricane.jpg" alt="Hurricane from satellite view">
        <p class="image-caption">A powerful hurricane seen from space. Hurricanes are among the most destructive extreme weather events.</p>
        
        <div class="fun-fact">
            <h3>Fun Fact!</h3>
            <p>Extreme weather is a natural part of Earth's climate system, but it can have serious impacts on communities. While we can't eliminate these natural hazards, we can reduce their impact through preparation and engineering solutions!</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Why Understanding Weather Patterns is Important</h2>
        <p>Weather follows patterns that scientists have observed over centuries. By studying these patterns, we can predict when and where extreme weather is likely to occur. For example, hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean typically develop between June 1st and November 30th each year. This knowledge helps people living in coastal areas prepare for potential storms.</p>
        
        <div class="info-box">
            <h3>How Prediction Helps</h3>
            <p>When we can predict extreme weather events, communities can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Evacuate dangerous areas</li>
                <li>Secure homes and buildings</li>
                <li>Prepare emergency supplies</li>
                <li>Activate emergency response teams</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All of these actions help reduce the impact when extreme weather strikes!</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Engineering Solutions for Coastal Areas</h2>
        <p>Coastal areas face unique challenges during extreme weather, particularly from hurricanes and storm surges that cause flooding and erosion. Engineers have developed several solutions to protect these areas:</p>
        
        <h3>Seawalls</h3>
        <p>Seawalls are concrete barriers built along beaches that experience large waves. They act as physical barriers that block water and prevent flooding as water rises during storms.</p>
        
        <h3>Recurved Seawalls</h3>
        <p>Recurved seawalls have a special curved surface at the top. This design not only blocks waves but also redirects the wave energy back out toward the ocean. Engineers have found that recurved walls are among the most effective ways to reduce coastal flooding because they actively push water away rather than just blocking it.</p>
        
        <img src="recurved_seawall.jpg" alt="Recurved seawall diagram">
        <p class="image-caption">A recurved seawall design showing how waves are redirected back toward the ocean instead of splashing over the wall.</p>
        
        <div class="activity">
            <h3>Think About It!</h3>
            <p>If you were testing different barriers to protect against flooding, how would you measure their effectiveness? Scientists measure the amount of water that gets past each barrier. In one experiment:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>With no barrier: Over 1000 mL of water flooded the test area</li>
                <li>With a high straight seawall: 300 mL of water flooded the area</li>
                <li>With rocks to break waves: 100 mL of water flooded the area</li>
                <li>With a recurved wall: Even less water flooded the area</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Which solution would you choose for your coastal community?</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Building on Stilts</h3>
        <p>Another effective solution for coastal homes is to build them on stilts or over garages. This elevates the living areas above potential flood levels, keeping water from entering the main parts of homes. This building technique has been used for centuries in coastal communities around the world.</p>
        
        <img src="stilt_house_on_coast.jpg" alt="Houses built on stilts in a coastal area">
        <p class="image-caption">Colorful coastal houses built on stilts to protect them from flooding during storms and high tides.</p>
        
        <h2>Engineering Solutions for High Winds</h2>
        <p>High winds from storms, hurricanes, and tornadoes can cause severe damage to buildings. The design of a home, especially its roof, can significantly affect how it withstands these winds.</p>
        
        <h3>Roof Designs: Gable vs. Hip Roofs</h3>
        
        <img src="gable-vs-hip-roof-design.jpg" alt="Comparison of gable and hip roof designs">
        <p class="image-caption">Left: A gable roof with straight sides forming an A-shape. Right: A hip roof with all sides sloped.</p>
        
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Gable Roof</th>
                <th>Hip Roof</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Has sides that are straight up and down, forming an "A" shape</td>
                <td>Has sides that are all slanted upward</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Wind can push directly against the flat sides</td>
                <td>Wind gets deflected upward along the slanted surfaces</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>May be pushed off a home by strong winds</td>
                <td>Better resistance to high winds</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>More vulnerable during storms</td>
                <td>Recommended for areas with frequent high winds</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        
        <div class="info-box">
            <h3>Understanding Wind Forces</h3>
            <p>When wind hits a flat surface (like the side of a gable roof), it creates direct pressure against that surface. But when wind hits a sloped surface (like all sides of a hip roof), the force is distributed and redirected upward, reducing the overall pressure on the structure.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Engineering Solutions for Lightning</h2>
        <p>Lightning is electricity moving through the air. When it strikes homes or buildings, it can cause fires, damage appliances, and destroy electrical systems.</p>
        
        <img src="Lightning_Strike_OneWorldTradeCenter_NYC_Skyline.jpg" alt="Lightning striking a skyscraper">
        <p class="image-caption">Lightning striking a tall building. Without proper protection, this could cause significant damage.</p>
        
        <h3>Lightning Rods</h3>
        <p>A lightning rod is a metal rod mounted on or near a building that protects it from electrical damage during storms. How does it work?</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The metal rod attracts lightning because electricity naturally seeks the path of least resistance</li>
            <li>When lightning strikes the rod, the electrical energy travels through the rod</li>
            <li>Wires connected to the rod direct the electricity safely down into the ground</li>
            <li>This prevents the electricity from traveling through the building and damaging electronics or starting fires</li>
        </ol>
        
        <img src="lightning_rod.jpg" alt="Lightning rod installed on a roof">
        <p class="image-caption">A lightning rod installed on a building's roof, designed to safely redirect lightning strikes to the ground.</p>
        
        <div class="fun-fact">
            <h3>Historical Note</h3>
            <p>Benjamin Franklin, one of America's founding fathers, experimented with lightning rods in the 1750s. He discovered that lightning is a form of electricity and invented the lightning rod to protect buildings. His invention is still used today, saving countless buildings from lightning damage!</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Engineering Solutions for Tornadoes</h2>
        <p>Tornadoes are columns of air that spin violently. Their winds can reach up to 300 miles per hour, strong enough to destroy houses and lift trees into the air.</p>
        
        <img src="tornado_1.jpg" alt="Tornado touching down in an open field">
        <p class="image-caption">A tornado touching down in an open field. These powerful weather events can cause devastating damage.</p>

        <p class="image-caption">A large tornado approaching a rural area. Tornadoes can form quickly and move unpredictably.</p>
        
        <h3>Tornado-Resistant Construction</h3>
        <p>Engineers have developed special building techniques and materials to help structures withstand tornado winds:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Safe Rooms:</strong> These are specially reinforced rooms built within a home that can withstand tornado-force winds, even if the rest of the house is destroyed</li>
            <li><strong>Reinforced Building Panels:</strong> Special panels made of concrete, steel, or composite materials can withstand high winds and flying debris</li>
            <li><strong>Stronger Connections:</strong> Using hurricane straps and stronger fasteners to connect walls to foundations and roofs to walls</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="image-caption">Special reinforced building panels designed to withstand the extreme forces of tornado winds.</p>
        
        <div class="info-box">
            <h3>Tornado Alley</h3>
            <p>Tornado Alley is a region that stretches from Texas to North Dakota in the central United States. This area experiences more tornadoes than any other part of the country due to its unique geography that creates the perfect conditions for tornado formation. Communities in this region often have special building codes and emergency plans for tornado protection.</p>
        </div>
        
        <img src="tornado_alley.jpg" alt="Map showing Tornado Alley in the United States">
        <p class="image-caption">A map highlighting Tornado Alley, the region of the United States with the highest frequency of tornadoes.</p>
        
        <h2>Solutions for Urban Heat</h2>
        <p>Urban areas often experience higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas due to the "heat island effect." This happens because concrete, asphalt, and buildings absorb and retain heat.</p>
        
        <h3>Cool Pavement Technologies</h3>
        <p>One solution to reduce urban heat is painting roads with reflective white paint. This simple technique can significantly lower temperatures on paved surfaces by reflecting sunlight rather than absorbing it. Other approaches include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Using lighter-colored building materials</li>
            <li>Installing green roofs (covered with plants)</li>
            <li>Creating more urban green spaces</li>
            <li>Using permeable pavements that allow water to pass through</li>
        </ul>
        
        <img src="white_street.jpg" alt="Street painted with reflective white paint">
        <p class="image-caption">A street painted with reflective white paint to reduce heat absorption during hot weather.</p>
        
        <div class="activity">
            <h3>Temperature Experiment</h3>
            <p>Try this at home: Place two pieces of paper—one black and one white—in direct sunlight for 15 minutes. Then touch them. Which one feels hotter? The black paper absorbs more sunlight, while the white paper reflects it. This same principle works for roads and buildings!</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Comparing Engineering Solutions</h2>
        <p>When engineers develop solutions for extreme weather, they must evaluate how effective each solution is. Here's how some solutions compare:</p>
