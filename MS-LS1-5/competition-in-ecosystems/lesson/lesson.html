        <h1>Competition in Ecosystems</h1>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>Welcome to our exciting journey into ecosystems! Today we'll explore how organisms compete for resources, how environmental and genetic factors affect survival, and the intricate connections that keep ecosystems balanced.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Understanding Competition in Ecosystems</h2>
        
        <p>In nature, organisms constantly interact with one another and their environment. One of the most important interactions is <strong>competition</strong>.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>Competition is the relationship between organisms that strive for the same resources within the same ecosystem. These resources are essential for survival, growth, and reproduction.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>What resources do organisms compete for?</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Animals</strong> compete for air, food, shelter, water, and space</li>
            <li><strong>Plants</strong> compete for air, water, sunlight, and space</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="plants_competing.jpg" alt="Plants competing for sunlight and space">
            <p class="image-caption">Plants competing for sunlight, water, and space. Notice how they stretch toward light sources and develop different heights to maximize their access to resources.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>These competitive interactions help maintain balance within ecosystems by regulating population sizes and ensuring that resources are distributed among different species.</p>
        
        <div class="activity">
            <div class="section-title">Think About It</div>
            <p>Imagine two squirrels in a forest with only one acorn between them. How would they compete for this resource? What might determine which squirrel gets the acorn?</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Environmental Factors and Competition</h2>
        
        <p>Environmental factors are the things in an organism's surroundings, including both living and nonliving elements, that affect its ability to survive and thrive.</p>
        
        <p>Some key environmental factors include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Weather conditions (temperature, rainfall, wind)</li>
            <li>Habitat size and quality</li>
            <li>Resource availability (food, water, shelter)</li>
            <li>Presence of other organisms (predators, competitors)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>When resources are limited due to environmental factors, competition becomes more intense. For example, during a drought, animals might compete more fiercely for water sources, and plants may struggle to obtain enough moisture from the soil.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Environmental factors can drastically affect an organism's ability to grow, reproduce, and survive. For instance:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A fox may live in many different areas, but if resources are limited in one location, it will not reach its full growth potential</li>
            <li>Plants growing in cramped conditions with limited space will not reach their maximum height and width</li>
            <li>During flood conditions, plants may be washed away, eliminating food sources for herbivores, which then affects the entire food web</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="activity">
            <div class="section-title">Scenario Challenge</div>
            <p>Consider a forest experiencing a severe drought. How would the limited water affect:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The growth of trees and smaller plants</li>
                <li>The behavior of animals in the forest</li>
                <li>The competition between similar species</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <h2>Genetic Factors in Survival and Competition</h2>
        
        <p>While environmental factors are external influences, genetic factors are inherited traits that come from an organism's parents.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>Genetic factors include inherited traits like physical characteristics (color, size, shape) and physiological capabilities that affect an organism's ability to compete successfully for resources.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="bee-eater_catching_bee.jpg" alt="Bee-eater bird catching a bee">
            <p class="image-caption">A bee-eater bird using its specialized beak and hunting skills to catch a bee. These genetic traits give it a competitive advantage in obtaining this specific food source.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Examples of important genetic traits include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Leg length</strong> - affects an animal's speed when hunting or escaping predators</li>
            <li><strong>Fur or feather color</strong> - provides camouflage to hide from predators or ambush prey</li>
            <li><strong>Beak shape in birds</strong> - determines what types of food they can eat, as shown in the bee-eater image above</li>
            <li><strong>Root system size in plants</strong> - affects ability to absorb water and nutrients</li>
            <li><strong>Drought resistance</strong> - allows some plants to survive with less water</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>These genetic traits can give organisms a competitive advantage. For example, a cheetah with genes for slightly longer legs might be faster than others, making it more successful at catching prey and therefore more likely to survive and reproduce.</p>
        
        <div class="fun-fact">
            Some plants have genetic adaptations that allow them to produce chemicals that inhibit the growth of competing plants nearby!
        </div>
        
        <div class="activity">
            <div class="section-title">Apply Your Knowledge</div>
            <p>Think about these scenarios:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Two rabbit species live in the same forest. One has brown fur, the other has white fur. During which season would each have an advantage, and why?</li>
                <li>How would genetic traits for height affect plants competing for sunlight under a forest canopy?</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <h2>Food Webs: Energy and Matter Transfer</h2>
        
        <p>A food web is a model that shows how energy and matter move through an ecosystem. It illustrates the connections between different organisms based on what they eat and what eats them.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>Food webs show the transfer of energy and matter between various organizational levels in an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web point from the organism being eaten to the organism doing the eating, showing the direction of energy flow.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="foodweb.jpg" alt="Food web showing connections between organisms">
            <p class="image-caption">A food web diagram showing how energy flows through different trophic levels in an ecosystem. Arrows indicate the direction of energy transfer from producers to primary consumers, secondary consumers, and top predators.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Key components of a food web include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Producers</strong> (usually plants) - create their own food using sunlight</li>
            <li><strong>Primary consumers</strong> - herbivores that eat producers</li>
            <li><strong>Secondary consumers</strong> - carnivores that eat herbivores</li>
            <li><strong>Tertiary consumers</strong> - top predators</li>
            <li><strong>Decomposers</strong> - break down dead organisms and return nutrients to the soil</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Food webs help scientists understand how changes to one population might affect others. For example, if a drought reduces plant growth, herbivore populations might decline, which would then impact predator populations.</p>
        
        <div class="activity">
            <div class="section-title">Critical Thinking</div>
            <p>Using the food web image above, consider what might happen if:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>One of the producer species was reduced by 50% due to disease</li>
                <li>A new predator that feeds on one of the middle-level consumers was introduced</li>
                <li>One of the top predators became extinct</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <h2>Invasive Species and Ecosystem Disruption</h2>
        
        <p>Invasive species are organisms that are not native to an ecosystem and whose introduction causes ecological harm.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>When invasive species enter a new ecosystem, they often lack natural predators or diseases that would normally control their population. This can lead to unchecked growth and severe competition with native species for limited resources.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="invasive_species_feral_pigs.jpg" alt="Feral pigs as invasive species">
            <p class="image-caption">Feral pigs with piglets. These invasive animals damage ecosystems by rooting up native vegetation, competing with native wildlife for food, and disrupting soil structures.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Invasive species can arrive in new ecosystems through various pathways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Intentional introduction by humans (for food, pest control, or decoration)</li>
            <li>Accidental transport (in ship ballast water, attached to vehicles, etc.)</li>
            <li>Natural spread assisted by humans (animals carrying seeds on their fur)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The impacts of invasive species can be dramatic:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>They may outcompete native species for resources</li>
            <li>They can alter habitat structure</li>
            <li>They might introduce new diseases</li>
            <li>They can disrupt established food webs</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>As shown in the image above, feral pigs introduced by early explorers as a food source have become a destructive invasive species in many parts of the United States. They root up native vegetation, compete with native wildlife for food, and damage ecosystems.</p>
        
        <div class="activity">
            <div class="section-title">Problem Solving</div>
            <p>Looking at the feral pig example:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>What native species might be most affected by their presence?</li>
                <li>How might the soil and plant communities change due to their rooting behavior?</li>
                <li>What management strategies might help control their impact?</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <h2>Studying Populations: Wildlife Biology</h2>
        
        <p>Scientists called wildlife biologists study populations of organisms and how they interact within ecosystems.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>Wildlife biologists track population sizes, monitor endangered species, study resource use, and sometimes intervene when populations become too large or too small for an ecosystem to support.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="image-container">

        </div>
        
        <p>Some of the work that wildlife biologists do includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Counting individuals in a population</li>
            <li>Tracking animal movements</li>
            <li>Studying feeding and reproductive behaviors</li>
            <li>Monitoring habitat quality</li>
            <li>Developing conservation strategies</li>
            <li>Relocating animals when an area becomes overpopulated</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>As shown in the images above, wildlife biology spans many ecosystems, from forests and grasslands to oceans and lakes. Marine biologists specialize in studying aquatic ecosystems and the unique competitive relationships that exist in underwater environments.</p>
        
        <div class="fun-fact">
            Some wildlife biologists use tools like radio collars, trail cameras, and even DNA analysis to study animal populations without disturbing them!
        </div>

        <h2>Putting It All Together: The Balance of Ecosystems</h2>
        
        <p>Ecosystems are complex systems with many interconnected parts. The balance between competition, environmental factors, and genetic adaptations helps maintain biodiversity and ecosystem health.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>When resources are abundant, competition is reduced, and many different species can thrive. When resources become limited due to environmental changes or the introduction of new competitors, the balance shifts, and some species may decline while others increase.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Understanding these relationships helps us:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Predict how ecosystems might respond to changes</li>
            <li>Manage natural resources sustainably</li>
            <li>Protect endangered species</li>
            <li>Restore damaged ecosystems</li>
            <li>Prevent or mitigate the impacts of invasive species</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="activity">
            <div class="section-title">Final Challenge</div>
            <p>Design a balanced ecosystem with at least:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Two plant species</li>
                <li>Two herbivore species</li>
                <li>One predator species</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Explain how these organisms would compete for resources, what environmental factors might affect them, and how their genetic traits might give them advantages.</p>
