    <div class="section">
        <h2>What Is a Chemical Reaction?</h2>
        <p>A chemical reaction is a process in which new substances are formed. During this process, atoms from the starting substances (called reactants) are regrouped into new substances (called products) that have different properties. One of the most important principles to remember is that the number of atoms before and after a chemical reaction always stays the same.</p>

            The atoms you start with are simply regrouped into new substances with different properties!

        <h2>Properties of Matter Change During Chemical Reactions</h2>
        <p>All matter has properties that can be observed and recorded. These properties help us identify substances and predict how they might interact with other substances.</p>

        </div>
        
        <p>When substances undergo chemical reactions, their properties change because the atoms rearrange to form new substances with different characteristics.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example:</strong> When iron (which is magnetic and silver-colored) reacts with oxygen in the air, it forms rust (iron oxide), which is reddish-brown and not magnetic. The properties have changed because a new substance has formed!

    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>The Law of Conservation of Matter</h2>
        <p>The total number of atoms does not change in a chemical reaction. This is called the Law of Conservation of Matter, which states that matter cannot be created or destroyed in chemical reactions, only rearranged.</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">

        <div class="highlight">
            Atoms can only rearrange themselves in a chemical reaction—they cannot be created or destroyed!
        </div>
        
        <p>Because of this law, the final mass after a reaction has taken place will be identical to the initial mass before the reaction took place, even though new substances have been formed.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example:</strong> In a combustion reaction of propane (C₃H₈) with oxygen (O₂), we get:
            <div class="chemical-equation">
                C₃H₈ + 5O₂ → 3CO₂ + 4H₂O
            </div>
            
            <p>Let's count the atoms on both sides:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Left side (reactants): 3 carbon atoms, 8 hydrogen atoms, and 10 oxygen atoms</li>
                <li>Right side (products): 3 carbon atoms, 8 hydrogen atoms (in H₂O), and 10 oxygen atoms (6 in CO₂ and 4 in H₂O)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The number of each type of atom is the same on both sides, demonstrating conservation of matter!</p>

            <strong>Important Note:</strong> Many students think dissolving is a physical change, but it's often a chemical reaction! When a substance dissolves, it can break down or interact with the solvent, resulting in new chemical arrangements.

        <div class="think-about">
            <strong>Think about it:</strong> When ice melts, it's still H₂O—just in liquid form. That's a physical change. But when iron rusts, it's no longer just iron—it's a new substance called iron oxide. That's a chemical change!

        <h2>Signs That a Chemical Reaction Has Occurred</h2>
        <p>How do we know when a chemical reaction has taken place? Here are some common signs:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Color change</li>
            <li>Production of a gas (bubbles)</li>
            <li>Formation of a solid (precipitate)</li>
            <li>Temperature change (heat released or absorbed)</li>
            <li>Light production</li>
            <li>Odor change</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="activity">
            <strong>Think about these examples:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>When you bake a cake, the ingredients change color and texture, and a new smell develops.</li>
                <li>When antacid tablets are dropped in water, bubbles form as a gas is produced.</li>
                <li>When vinegar and baking soda mix, bubbles form and the mixture feels cold.</li>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Catalysts in Chemical Reactions</h2>
        <p>A catalyst is a substance that speeds up a chemical reaction without becoming part of the final product. It works by lowering the energy needed to start the reaction, but it remains unchanged at the end.</p>
        
        <div class="note">
            <strong>Important:</strong> Catalysts are not consumed in reactions. They help the reaction happen faster, but they don't become part of the new substances formed.
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example:</strong> In your body, enzymes act as catalysts. An enzyme called catalase helps break down hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) into water (H₂O) and oxygen (O₂) very quickly. Without the catalase, this reaction would happen much more slowly.

    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Molecules: Groups of Atoms Working Together</h2>
        <p>Molecules are formed when two or more atoms bond together. The properties of a molecule are different from the properties of the individual atoms that make it up.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Examples of molecules:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Oxygen gas (O₂): two oxygen atoms bonded together</li>
                <li>Water (H₂O): two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom bonded together</li>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A chemical reaction is a process where atoms rearrange to form new substances with different properties.</li>
            <li>The Law of Conservation of Matter states that matter cannot be created or destroyed in chemical reactions, so the total number of atoms remains the same.</li>
            <li>In a chemical reaction, reactants combine to form products.</li>
            <li>Chemical changes result in new substances being formed, while physical changes don't create new substances.</li>
            <li>We can identify chemical reactions by changes in properties such as color, temperature, odor, or the production of gas or solid.</li>
            <li>Catalysts speed up chemical reactions without becoming part of the products.</li>
            <li>Chemical reactions are essential to many fields and everyday life.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            Remember: In any chemical reaction, the atoms just rearrange themselves—they're never created or destroyed!
