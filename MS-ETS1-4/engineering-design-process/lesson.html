    <h1>The Engineering Design Process: A Systematic Approach to Problem Solving</h1>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Introduction to Engineering Design</h2>
        <p>Engineering is the application of scientific, mathematical, and design principles to solve real-world problems. Engineers work on countless challenges—from creating faster vehicles to designing medical devices that save lives, from reducing pollution to building more sustainable infrastructure.</p>
        
        <p>At the heart of all engineering work lies a systematic approach called the <strong>Engineering Design Process</strong>.</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="engineering_design_process.jpg" alt="Engineering Design Process Overview">
            <p class="image-caption">The engineering design process is a systematic approach used by engineers to solve problems</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="key-point">
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The engineering design process is a series of steps that guides engineers through the creative process of solving problems. While there are many versions of this process—some with as few as six steps and others with as many as 19—they all share three fundamental phases.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>The Three Main Phases of Engineering Design</h2>
        <p>Despite variations in how the process is presented, all engineering design approaches include these three core phases:</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="3_phase_engineering_design_process.jpg" alt="Three Phases of Engineering Design Process">
            <p class="image-caption">The three main phases: Define the Problem, Develop Possible Solutions, and Optimize the Design Solution</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="image-container">

            <p class="image-caption">A flowchart showing how the engineering design process functions in an iterative manner</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Phase 1: Define the Problem</h3>
        <p>In this initial phase, engineers work to understand exactly what needs to be solved. They identify and clearly articulate:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The problem statement</strong> - A clear description of what needs to be addressed</li>
            <li><strong>Design criteria</strong> - The requirements that must be met for a successful solution</li>
            <li><strong>Design constraints</strong> - The limitations that any solution must work within</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="defining_the_problem.jpg" alt="Engineers Defining a Problem">
            <p class="image-caption">Engineers discussing and defining a problem before beginning the design process</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="key-point">
            <p><strong>Criteria</strong> are the requirements needed for a design to be considered successful. Examples include: must filter 99% of contaminants, must support 500 pounds, must operate for 8 hours on a single charge.</p>
            <p><strong>Constraints</strong> are the limitations placed on potential solutions. Examples include: must cost under $100 to manufacture, must use recycled materials, must be completed within 3 months, must weigh less than 5 pounds.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Phase 2: Develop Possible Solutions</h3>
        <p>Once the problem is clearly defined, engineers begin generating ideas for possible solutions. This phase often includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Brainstorming</strong> - Generating many ideas without judgment</li>
            <li><strong>Research</strong> - Investigating existing solutions and relevant information</li>
            <li><strong>Sketching and diagramming</strong> - Creating visual representations of ideas</li>
            <li><strong>Modeling</strong> - Developing physical or digital models to test concepts</li>
            <li><strong>Material testing</strong> - Evaluating potential materials for the solution</li>
            <li><strong>Expert consultation</strong> - Seeking input from specialists or users</li>
        </ul>

            <p class="image-caption">Engineers engaged in brainstorming and research activities to develop potential solutions</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Phase 3: Optimize the Design Solution</h3>
        <p>In this final phase, engineers refine their solutions through testing and improvement:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Building prototypes</strong> - Creating working models of the best designs</li>
            <li><strong>Testing and data collection</strong> - Evaluating how well prototypes perform</li>
            <li><strong>Data analysis</strong> - Examining test results to identify strengths and weaknesses</li>
            <li><strong>Iterative improvements</strong> - Making changes based on test results</li>
            <li><strong>Final evaluation</strong> - Assessing how well the solution meets criteria and constraints</li>
        </ul>

        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>The Iterative Nature of Engineering Design</h2>
        <p>A key characteristic of the engineering design process is that it is <strong>iterative</strong>, not linear. Engineers frequently:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Move back and forth between phases</li>
            <li>Repeat steps as new information emerges</li>
            <li>Return to earlier phases when challenges arise</li>
            <li>Continually refine their understanding of the problem and potential solutions</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example of Iteration:</h3>
            <p>An engineer developing a new water filtration system might create a prototype, test it, discover it filters too slowly, return to the brainstorming phase to generate new filter designs, create another prototype, test again, and continue this cycle until the optimal solution is achieved.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Phase 1 Deep Dive: Defining the Problem</h2>
        <p>The foundation of successful engineering design is a clearly defined problem. Engineers may:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Be assigned a specific problem to solve</li>
            <li>Identify problems through observation of the natural or designed world</li>
            <li>Recognize opportunities for improvement in existing systems</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>A well-defined problem statement should include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What the solution needs to accomplish (criteria)</li>
            <li>What limitations exist (constraints)</li>
            <li>Who the solution is for (users)</li>
            <li>Why the solution is needed (purpose)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="activity">
            <h3>Try It Yourself: Creating a Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>Choose one of these scenarios and create a detailed problem statement with at least three criteria and three constraints:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A device to help elderly people pick up objects from the floor</li>
                <li>A system to collect rainwater for garden irrigation</li>
                <li>A method to reduce food waste in school cafeterias</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Phase 2 Deep Dive: Developing Possible Solutions</h2>
        
        <h3>The Power of Brainstorming</h3>
        <p>Brainstorming is an informal, creative process for generating ideas without judgment. Effective brainstorming:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Welcomes all ideas, no matter how unusual</li>
            <li>Postpones evaluation until later stages</li>
            <li>Can be done individually or in groups</li>
            <li>Focuses on quantity of ideas first, quality later</li>
            <li>Documents all ideas through sketches, notes, or diagrams</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>The Role of Research</h3>
        <p>Research helps engineers build on existing knowledge rather than reinventing the wheel. Research may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reviewing scientific literature</li>
            <li>Studying existing solutions to similar problems</li>
            <li>Consulting with experts or potential users</li>
            <li>Investigating materials and technologies</li>
            <li>Testing properties of materials or components</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Models and Representations</h3>
        <p>Engineers use various types of models to explore and communicate their ideas:</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Model Type</th>
                <th>Description</th>

        <h2>Phase 3 Deep Dive: Optimizing the Design Solution</h2>
        
        <h3>The Role of Prototypes</h3>
        <p>A prototype is a preliminary model built to test and demonstrate the functionality of a design solution. Prototypes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Transform abstract ideas into tangible objects</li>
            <li>Allow for hands-on testing and evaluation</li>
            <li>Reveal unforeseen problems or limitations</li>
            <li>Provide concrete data for improvement</li>
            <li>Help communicate ideas to stakeholders</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Testing and Data Collection</h3>
        <p>Testing is crucial for optimizing designs. Engineers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Develop specific test procedures based on design criteria</li>
            <li>Collect quantitative data (measurements, times, forces, etc.)</li>
            <li>Gather qualitative data (user feedback, observations)</li>
            <li>Document both successes and failures</li>
            <li>Use structured methods to ensure consistent testing</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Data Analysis and Design Improvement</h3>
        <p>Once data is collected, engineers analyze it to guide improvements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Identify patterns or trends in test results</li>
            <li>Compare performance against criteria and constraints</li>
            <li>Pinpoint specific components or features needing improvement</li>
            <li>Develop theories about why certain aspects performed as they did</li>
            <li>Prioritize modifications based on impact and feasibility</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Making Systematic Modifications</h3>
        <p>Effective optimization involves making targeted, systematic changes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Change one variable at a time when possible</li>
            <li>Document each modification and its effects</li>
            <li>Focus on the most critical performance issues first</li>
            <li>Consider trade-offs between different criteria</li>
            <li>Balance performance improvements against constraints</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example of Optimization:</h3>
            <p>An engineer developing a solar-powered toy car might collect data on how fast it moves in different lighting conditions. Analysis might reveal it moves too slowly in moderate light. The engineer might then systematically test different solar panel configurations, more efficient motors, or lighter materials to optimize performance while staying within cost constraints.</p>
