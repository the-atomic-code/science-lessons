        <h1>Competition in Ecosystems</h1>
        <div class="section">
        <h2>Introduction to Competition in Ecosystems</h2>
        <p>In the natural world, organisms constantly interact with each other and their environment. One of the most important types of interactions is <span class="term">competition</span>, where organisms strive for the same limited resources in an ecosystem.</p>
        
        <div class="key-point">
            <p>Competition occurs when multiple organisms need the same limited resources to survive, grow, and reproduce. These resources include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Food</li>
                <li>Water</li>
                <li>Space</li>
                <li>Shelter</li>
                <li>Sunlight (for plants)</li>
                <li>Air</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>Competition helps maintain balance in ecosystems by regulating population sizes. When resources are plentiful, populations tend to grow. When resources become scarce, population growth slows or declines as organisms compete more intensely for what's available.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Environmental Factors and Competition</h2>
        <p><span class="term">Environmental factors</span> are the things in an organism's surroundings, including both living and nonliving components. These factors significantly influence how organisms compete for resources.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example: How Environmental Factors Affect Competition</h3>
            <p>Consider what happens during a drought:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Water becomes a limited resource</li>
                <li>Plants compete more intensely for available water</li>
                <li>Some plants may wilt or die if they cannot access enough water</li>
                <li>Animals that depend on these plants for food or shelter are then affected</li>
                <li>The entire ecosystem experiences changes as resources become limited</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>Similarly, natural disasters like floods can drastically alter resource availability. During a flood:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Plants may be washed away, reducing food for herbivores</li>
            <li>Animal shelters may be destroyed, forcing them to compete for new homes</li>
            <li>Water quality might decrease, affecting aquatic organisms</li>
            <li>New competition patterns emerge as survivors adapt to changed conditions</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="key-point">
            <p>Limited resources affect an organism's ability to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Survive</strong> - obtain necessary resources for basic life functions</li>
                <li><strong>Grow</strong> - develop to full potential size and maturity</li>
                <li><strong>Reproduce</strong> - produce offspring to continue the species</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Genetic Factors in Competition</h2>
        <p><span class="term">Genetic factors</span> are inherited traits passed from parents to offspring. These traits can give organisms advantages or disadvantages when competing for resources.</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="bee-eater_catching_bee.jpg" alt="Bee-eater bird catching a bee">
            <p class="caption">A bee-eater bird using its specialized beak and hunting skills to catch a bee. This demonstrates how genetic traits like beak shape and hunting ability provide competitive advantages for obtaining food.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            <h3>Key Genetic Advantages in Competition:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Physical adaptations:</strong> Leg length affects running speed for catching prey or escaping predators</li>
                <li><strong>Camouflage:</strong> Fur or feather coloration helps animals hide from predators or sneak up on prey</li>
                <li><strong>Size:</strong> Larger individuals might access food sources that smaller ones cannot reach</li>
                <li><strong>Specialized features:</strong> Beak shapes in birds determine what types of food they can efficiently collect</li>
                <li><strong>Physiological traits:</strong> Ability to survive with less water or food during scarce times</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>When two similar species compete for the same resource, the species with advantageous genetic traits often outcompetes the other. This principle helped Charles Darwin develop his theory of natural selection.</p>
        
        <div class="activity">
            <h3>Think About It:</h3>
            <p>Two bird species feed on the same type of seeds. One species has a strong, thick beak that can crack tough seeds easily. The other has a thinner beak that struggles with tough seed coats. If tough-coated seeds become the predominant food source, which species would likely thrive? Which might decline?</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Food Webs and Energy Transfer</h2>
        <p>A <span class="term">food web</span> is a model showing how energy and matter move through an ecosystem. It represents the feeding relationships between organisms and helps us understand competition dynamics.</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="foodweb.jpg" alt="Food web diagram showing energy transfer">
            <p class="caption">A food web diagram showing how energy flows from producers to various levels of consumers. Arrows indicate the direction of energy transfer between organisms.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="key-point">
            <p>Food webs show:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How energy flows from producers (plants) to various levels of consumers</li>
                <li>How matter cycles through the ecosystem</li>
                <li>Which organisms compete for the same food resources</li>
                <li>How changes in one population can affect many others</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>In a food web, arrows point from the organism being eaten to the organism eating it, showing the direction of energy transfer. When one resource becomes limited, it affects all organisms that depend on it.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example: Energy Transfer in a Food Web</h3>
            <p>Consider a prairie ecosystem:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sunlight energy is captured by grasses and flowering plants (producers)</li>
                <li>Grasshoppers and mice eat the plants (primary consumers)</li>
                <li>Snakes eat the mice and grasshoppers (secondary consumers)</li>
                <li>Hawks eat the snakes (tertiary consumers)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If a drought reduces plant populations, less energy is available for grasshoppers and mice. With fewer grasshoppers and mice, snakes have less food. This continues up the food web, affecting hawk populations as well.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Plant Competition</h2>
        <p>Plants compete for resources just as animals do, but their competition focuses on different resources.</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="plants_competing.jpg" alt="Plants competing for sunlight and space">
            <p class="caption">Plants growing in close proximity compete for sunlight, water, nutrients, and space. Notice how some plants stretch upward to access more light.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="key-point">
            <p>Plants primarily compete for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Essential for photosynthesis</li>
                <li><strong>Water:</strong> Needed for nutrient transport and photosynthesis</li>
                <li><strong>Nutrients in soil:</strong> Required for growth and development</li>
                <li><strong>Space:</strong> Room for roots to spread and leaves to access sunlight</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example: Competition Under a Tree Canopy</h3>
            <p>Plants growing beneath a large tree face significant competition for sunlight. The tree's canopy blocks much of the sunlight from reaching the ground. In this situation:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Shade-tolerant plants might thrive despite lower light levels</li>
                <li>Plants requiring full sun will grow poorly or die</li>
                <li>Some plants develop longer stems to reach higher toward available light</li>
                <li>Plants with larger leaves can capture more of the limited light</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Plants that receive little to no sunlight cannot photosynthesize effectively and will not survive long-term in this environment.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Plants also compete for space. When too many plants grow in a confined area, none can reach their full potential size because their roots compete for the same soil resources and their leaves compete for sunlight.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Invasive Species and Ecosystem Competition</h2>
        <p>An <span class="term">invasive species</span> is an organism that is not native to an ecosystem and causes ecological or economic harm. Invasive species often disrupt competition patterns in ecosystems.</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="invasive_species_feral_pigs.jpg" alt="Feral pigs, an invasive species">
            <p class="caption">Feral pigs are an invasive species in many parts of the United States. They compete with native wildlife for resources and can cause significant habitat destruction.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="key-point">
            <p>Invasive species typically:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Have no natural predators in the new ecosystem</li>
                <li>Reproduce rapidly and spread quickly</li>
                <li>Outcompete native species for resources</li>
                <li>Can dramatically alter ecosystem structure and function</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example: Invasive Species Impact</h3>
            <p>When wild pigs were introduced to new regions by early explorers as a food source, they became invasive in many areas. These non-native pigs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Consume the same food resources that native animals depend on</li>
                <li>Reproduce quickly without natural population controls</li>
                <li>Destroy habitat by rooting through soil and vegetation</li>
                <li>Reduce available resources for native species</li>
                <li>Can cause native populations to decline through competition</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>Invasive species can enter ecosystems through various pathways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Deliberate introduction by humans (for food, pest control, etc.)</li>
            <li>Accidental transport (in ship ballast water, attached to vehicles)</li>
            <li>Seeds carried on animal fur or in animal waste</li>
            <li>Escape of pets or ornamental plants into the wild</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Population Dynamics and Resource Availability</h2>
        <p>The relationship between population size and resource availability is fundamental to understanding competition in ecosystems.</p>
        
        <div class="key-point">
            <p>Key principles of population dynamics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>When resources are abundant, populations tend to grow</li>
                <li>When resources are scarce, populations tend to decline</li>
                <li>Competition intensifies as resources become more limited</li>
                <li>Population size is regulated by resource availability</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example: Population Response to Resource Changes</h3>
            <p>Consider a population of deer in a forest:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>With abundant food (vegetation), the deer population increases</li>
                <li>As the population grows, more deer compete for the same resources</li>
                <li>Eventually, food becomes limited relative to population size</li>
                <li>Some deer may not get enough food and become weaker</li>
                <li>Weaker individuals may die or produce fewer offspring</li>
                <li>The population size stabilizes or decreases</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>Scientists study these population dynamics to understand ecosystem health. Wildlife biologists monitor animal populations, track endangered species, and sometimes relocate animals when an area becomes overpopulated.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Seasonal Changes and Competition</h2>
        <p>Competition for resources often changes with the seasons as resource availability fluctuates throughout the year.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example: Seasonal Competition Patterns</h3>
            <p>In a temperate forest ecosystem:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Plants compete for light as they leaf out; animals compete for nesting sites</li>
                <li><strong>Summer:</strong> Competition for water intensifies, especially during dry periods</li>
                <li><strong>Fall:</strong> Animals compete for food to store for winter or build fat reserves</li>
                <li><strong>Winter:</strong> Competition for limited food sources and shelter becomes critical for survival</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>Organisms have developed various adaptations to deal with seasonal resource changes, including migration, hibernation, food storage, and changing diet preferences.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Territory and Shelter Competition</h2>
        <p>Many animals compete for territory and shelter, which provide protection from predators and the elements.</p>
        
        <div class="key-point">
            <p>Territory and shelter are critical because they:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide safe places to raise young</li>
                <li>Offer protection from weather and predators</li>
                <li>Often include access to food and water resources</li>
                <li>May be essential for attracting mates</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example: Competition After Habitat Disturbance</h3>
            <p>After a forest fire destroys many trees that provided nesting cavities for birds:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The remaining cavity-bearing trees become a limited resource</li>
                <li>Multiple bird species compete intensely for the few available nesting sites</li>
                <li>Larger or more aggressive birds may claim the best sites</li>
                <li>Some birds may fail to reproduce that season due to lack of suitable nesting sites</li>
                <li>Over time, population sizes adjust to the new resource availability</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="question">Q1: How might limited sunlight affect plant growth under a large tree?</p>
            <p>Plants under a large tree receive less sunlight. Plants need sunlight for photosynthesis, which produces the energy they need to grow. With limited sunlight, plants will grow more slowly, may not reach their full height, and might have fewer leaves and flowers. Some shade-tolerant species might survive, while plants requiring full sun will likely die or grow very poorly.</p>
            
            <p class="question">Q2: What does a food web show about ecosystems?</p>
            <p>A food web shows how energy and matter are transferred between organisms in an ecosystem. It illustrates feeding relationships, shows which organisms compete for the same food resources, and helps predict how changes in one population can affect others. The arrows in a food web point from the organism being eaten to the organism doing the eating, showing energy flow direction.</p>
            
            <p class="question">Q3: How do invasive species affect native populations?</p>
            <p>Invasive species often lack natural predators in their new environment, allowing their populations to grow unchecked. They compete with native species for limited resources like food, water, and shelter. This increased competition can reduce native species' access to essential resources, potentially leading to population declines or even local extinctions of native species.</p>
            
            <p class="question">Q4: How might camouflage give an animal a competitive advantage?</p>
            <p>Camouflage is a genetic adaptation that helps animals blend into their environment. This provides two competitive advantages: it helps predators remain hidden while hunting, allowing them to catch more prey and secure more food resources; and it helps prey animals avoid being detected by predators, increasing their survival rates and allowing them to access resources with less risk.</p>
            
            <p class="question">Q5: How would a flood affect resource availability in an ecosystem?</p>
            <p>A flood can drastically alter resource availability. It might wash away plants that animals depend on for food, destroy shelters and nesting sites, contaminate water sources, and displace animals from their territories. After a flood, competition for remaining resources intensifies as organisms struggle to find new sources of food and shelter in the altered landscape.</p>

            <p class="question">1. If food resources suddenly become scarce in an ecosystem, what might happen to the animal populations that depend on those resources?</p>
            <p class="question">2. How does the availability of resources relate to population growth in an ecosystem?</p>
            <p class="question">3. If two plant species are growing under a large tree with limited sunlight, what factors might determine which species survives better?</p>
            <p class="question">4. How might genetic traits like running speed affect an animal's ability to obtain food?</p>
            <p class="question">5. If an invasive species with no natural predators enters an ecosystem, how might this affect the availability of resources for native species over time?</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <ul>
                <li>Competition occurs when organisms strive for the same limited resources (food, water, space, shelter, light).</li>
                <li>Environmental factors like weather events and seasons affect resource availability and competition intensity.</li>
                <li>Genetic factors like physical adaptations and camouflage can give organisms advantages in resource competition.</li>
                <li>Food webs show energy and matter transfer through ecosystems and help us understand competition relationships.</li>
                <li>Plants compete primarily for sunlight, water, nutrients, and space.</li>
                <li>Invasive species often disrupt ecosystems by competing with native species for resources.</li>
                <li>Population sizes are regulated by resource availability—populations grow when resources are abundant and decline when resources are scarce.</li>
                <li>Competition helps maintain balance in ecosystems by regulating population sizes.</li>
                <li>Scientists like wildlife biologists and marine biologists study these interactions to help protect and manage ecosystems.</li>
