    <h1>Extreme Weather and Engineering Solutions</h1>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>What is Extreme Weather?</h2>
        <p>Extreme weather refers to any weather conditions that fall outside of normal patterns. These include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Heavy winds</li>
            <li>Thunderstorms</li>
            <li>Floods</li>
            <li>Heat waves</li>
            <li>Tornadoes</li>
            <li>Hurricanes</li>
            <li>Hail</li>
            <li>Blizzards</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="hurricane.jpg" alt="Satellite view of a hurricane approaching coastline">
            <p class="image-caption">A powerful hurricane viewed from space, showing its distinctive spiral structure</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="fun-fact">
            <p><span class="key-point">Fun Fact:</span> While we can't prevent extreme weather from happening, scientists and engineers have developed many solutions to reduce its impact on people and property!</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Extreme weather is a result of natural processes that occur all around the globe. Weather is something people experience every day, but extreme weather is so intense that it deserves special attention.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Predicting Extreme Weather</h2>
        <p>By studying weather patterns over time, scientists can often predict when and where certain types of extreme weather might occur.</p>
        <p>For example, based on data collected over centuries, we know that hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean typically occur between June 1st and November 30th each year. This allows people living in coastal areas to prepare themselves before hurricane season begins.</p>
        
        <div class="activity">
            <p><span class="key-point">Think About It:</span> How might knowing when a hurricane could hit help people reduce the damage it causes?</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>While we can predict seasonal patterns of some extreme weather events, other types like tornadoes can be much harder to predict exactly when and where they will occur. Scientists can often identify conditions that might lead to tornadoes, but pinpointing exactly when one will touch down remains challenging.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Engineering Solutions for Coastal Areas</h2>
        <p>Coastal areas often experience flooding from extreme weather events like hurricanes and storms. Engineers have developed several solutions to protect these areas:</p>
        
        <h3>Seawalls</h3>
        <p>Seawalls are concrete walls built along beaches that experience large waves. These physical barriers help block water and prevent flooding as water rises during storms.</p>
        
        <h3>Recurved Seawalls</h3>
        <p>A special type of seawall with a curved surface is known as a <span class="key-point">recurved wall</span>. These walls are especially effective because they not only block waves but also send the wave energy back out toward the ocean. This redirection of energy helps reduce flooding even more effectively than straight seawalls.</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="recurved_seawall.jpg" alt="A recurved seawall protecting a coastal area">
            <p class="image-caption">A recurved seawall with its distinctive curved top that redirects wave energy back to the sea</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="comparison">
            <div class="comparison-item">
                <h4>Straight Seawall</h4>
                <p>Simply blocks water but absorbs the full force of waves</p>
                <p>Moderate flood protection</p>
            </div>
            <div class="comparison-item">
                <h4>Recurved Seawall</h4>
                <p>Blocks water AND redirects wave energy back to sea</p>
                <p>Superior flood protection</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Building on Stilts or Elevated Foundations</h3>
        <p>Another way to protect against flooding is to construct buildings on stilts or on top of garages. This raises the living areas above potential flood levels, keeping water from entering homes.</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="stilt_house_on_coast.jpg" alt="Houses built on stilts along a coastline">
            <p class="image-caption">Coastal homes built on stilts to prevent flooding during high water events</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="fun-fact">
            <p><span class="key-point">Did You Know?</span> In testing, areas with no flood protection collected over 1000 mL of water, while areas protected by recurved walls collected almost no water at all!</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Engineering Solutions for High Winds</h2>
        <p>High winds from hurricanes and tornadoes can cause severe damage to buildings, especially roofs. The shape of a roof dramatically affects how well it withstands high winds.</p>
        
        <h3>Roof Designs</h3>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="gable-vs-hip-roof-design.jpg" alt="Comparison of gable and hip roof designs">
            <p class="image-caption">Comparison between gable roof (left) and hip roof (right) designs</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="comparison">
            <div class="comparison-item">
                <h4>Gable Roof</h4>
                <p>Has sides that are straight up and down forming an "A" shape</p>
                <p>Wind pushes directly against the flat surface</p>
                <p>More vulnerable to high winds and may be pushed completely off a home</p>
            </div>
            <div class="comparison-item">
                <h4>Hip Roof</h4>
                <p>Has sides that are all slanted up</p>
                <p>Wind gets deflected upward instead of pushing directly against the side</p>
                <p>Much more resistant to high winds</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <p>Engineers recommend hip roofs for areas that frequently experience high winds because the slanted design helps the wind flow over the roof rather than pushing against it.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Engineering Solutions for Lightning</h2>
        <p>Lightning is a powerful form of electricity moving through the air. When it strikes homes, it can damage the building and electrical appliances inside.</p>
        
        <div class="side-by-side">
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="Lightning_Strike_OneWorldTradeCenter_NYC_Skyline.jpg" alt="Lightning striking a skyscraper">

                <p class="image-caption">A lightning rod installed on the roof of a house</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Lightning Rods</h3>
        <p>Lightning rods are metal rods mounted on or near buildings. They work by:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Attracting lightning strikes (because electricity naturally flows toward metal)</li>
            <li>Providing a direct path for the electrical energy to follow</li>
            <li>Transferring the energy safely to the ground through wires</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>This prevents the electrical energy from passing through the building itself, protecting both the structure and the electronics inside.</p>
        
        <div class="fun-fact">
            <p><span class="key-point">Historical Note:</span> Benjamin Franklin, one of America's founding fathers, conducted experiments with lightning rods to better understand electricity. His discoveries helped develop the lightning protection systems we use today.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Tests have shown that homes with properly installed lightning rods maintain power during lightning strikes, while homes without them often experience electrical damage and power outages.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Engineering Solutions for Tornadoes</h2>
        <p>Tornadoes are columns of air that spin violently, with winds that can reach up to 300 miles per hour. These extreme winds can destroy houses and uproot trees.</p>
        
        <div class="side-by-side">
            <div class="image-container">

            </div>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Tornado Alley</h3>
        <p>A region of the United States stretching from Texas to North Dakota is known as "Tornado Alley" because it experiences more tornadoes than any other area in the country. People living in this region need to be especially prepared for these extreme weather events.</p>

        </div>
        
        <h3>Safe Rooms and Special Building Materials</h3>
        <p>Engineers have developed special building panels that can withstand the winds of a tornado. These can be used to create safe rooms within homes. Even if a tornado destroys most of the house, these specially reinforced rooms remain intact, keeping people inside safe.</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">

        <h2>Solutions for Urban Heat</h2>
        <p>Urban areas often experience higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas due to the concentration of buildings, pavement, and reduced vegetation. This is known as the "urban heat island effect."</p>
        
        <h3>Reflective Surfaces</h3>
        <p>One innovative solution is painting roads with reflective white paint. This simple change:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reflects sunlight instead of absorbing it</li>
            <li>Reduces surface temperatures on paved areas</li>
            <li>Helps lower the overall temperature in urban areas</li>
        </ul>

        </div>
        
        <p>Dark surfaces like traditional asphalt absorb heat, making areas hotter. White or light-colored surfaces reflect heat away, helping to keep areas cooler during extreme heat events.</p>
