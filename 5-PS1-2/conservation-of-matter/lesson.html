        <h1>The Conservation of Matter</h1>
        
        <div class="key-point">
            <h3>What is the Law of Conservation of Matter?</h3>
            <p>The Law of Conservation of Matter states that the amount of matter stays the same, even when matter changes form. In other words, matter cannot be created or destroyed; it can only change from one form to another.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>What is Matter?</h2>
        <p>Matter is anything that has weight (mass) and takes up space (volume). Everything you can see and touch is made of matter. The air you breathe, the water you drink, and the food you eat are all examples of matter.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <h3>The Three States of Matter</h3>
            <p>Matter exists in three main states:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Solid:</strong> Has a definite shape and volume (like a rock or ice cube)</li>
                <li><strong>Liquid:</strong> Has a definite volume but takes the shape of its container (like water or juice)</li>
                <li><strong>Gas:</strong> Has neither definite shape nor volume and expands to fill its container (like air or water vapor)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="conservation_of_matter_ice_water.jpg" alt="Ice cubes melting in water">
                <div class="image-caption">Ice (solid) melting into water (liquid) - an example of a phase change where matter is conserved</div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>How Matter Changes Form</h2>
        <p>Matter can change from one state to another through various processes, but the total amount of matter always remains the same. Let's explore some common examples:</p>

        <div class="experiment">
            <h3>Experiment 1: Dissolving Sugar in Water</h3>
            <p>When you add 25 grams of sugar to 150 grams of water and stir, the sugar seems to disappear! But has it really vanished?</p>
            <p><strong>What happens:</strong> The sugar dissolves in the water, breaking down into tiny particles that spread throughout the water. Even though you can't see the sugar anymore, it's still there!</p>
            <p><strong>The evidence:</strong> If you weigh the sugar water, it will weigh 175 grams (25g sugar + 150g water). This proves the sugar didn't disappear—it just changed form.</p>
            <p><strong>Further proof:</strong> If you boil the water away, the sugar will reappear as crystals. The sugar was there the whole time!</p>
            
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="sugar_crystals_appearing_after_boiling_sugar_solution.jpg" alt="Sugar crystals reappearing after boiling sugar solution">
                <div class="image-caption">Sugar crystals reappear after the water has evaporated, showing that the sugar was present all along</div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>When a substance dissolves, it doesn't disappear—it simply changes form and becomes evenly distributed throughout the liquid. The total mass remains the same!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="experiment">
            <h3>Experiment 2: Boiling Water</h3>
            <p>When water boils, it changes from a liquid to a gas called water vapor.</p>
            <p><strong>What happens:</strong> As the water heats up, its molecules gain energy and move faster until they escape into the air as water vapor. It may seem like the water is disappearing, but it's just changing form.</p>
            <p><strong>The evidence:</strong> If you boil water in an open pot, the water level decreases. But if you could capture all the water vapor and weigh it, it would weigh exactly the same as the original liquid water.</p>
            
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="boiling_water.jpg" alt="Water boiling in a pot">
                <div class="image-caption">Water boiling and changing from liquid to gas (water vapor). The water appears to disappear but is actually changing state.</div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="experiment">
            <h3>Experiment 3: Dry Ice Transformation</h3>
            <p>Dry ice is frozen carbon dioxide. Unlike regular ice, dry ice doesn't melt into a liquid—it transforms directly from a solid to a gas in a process called sublimation.</p>
            <p><strong>What happens:</strong> The dry ice appears to be "smoking" as it transforms, but that's actually the cold carbon dioxide gas becoming visible when it condenses water vapor in the air.</p>
            <p><strong>The evidence:</strong> If you place dry ice in a sealed container with a balloon on top, the balloon will inflate as the dry ice turns to gas. If you weigh the entire setup before and after, the weight remains the same—proving that no matter was lost or gained!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>Phase changes (solid → liquid → gas) don't create or destroy matter. The total amount of matter stays the same, even when it changes form!</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Chemical Reactions and Conservation of Matter</h2>
        <p>Chemical reactions create new substances, but they still follow the Law of Conservation of Matter. Let's see how:</p>

        <div class="experiment">
            <h3>Experiment 4: Creating a "Fire Snake"</h3>
            <p>When you mix sugar and baking soda and heat them, a chemical reaction occurs that produces a snake-like foam that's much larger than the original mixture.</p>
            <p><strong>What happens:</strong> The heat causes the sugar to caramelize and the baking soda to release carbon dioxide gas. These gases form bubbles that expand and create the snake-like structure.</p>
            <p><strong>The evidence:</strong> If you weigh the ingredients before (let's say 25 grams total), and then weigh the "snake" afterward (about 23 grams), you'll notice a small difference. This is because some carbon dioxide gas escaped into the air. If you could capture and weigh all the gases released, the total would still be 25 grams!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="experiment">
            <h3>Experiment 5: Burning a Candle</h3>
            <p>When a candle burns, it appears to slowly disappear. Is matter being destroyed?</p>
            <p><strong>What happens:</strong> The heat of the flame melts the wax, which is then drawn up the wick. The hot wax reacts with oxygen in the air, producing carbon dioxide gas, water vapor, and heat energy.</p>
            <p><strong>The evidence:</strong> If you burn a candle in a sealed container and could capture all the gases produced, the total weight would be the same as the original candle plus the oxygen used in burning.</p>
            
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="candle_burning.jpg" alt="Candle burning">
                <div class="image-caption">A burning candle - the wax appears to disappear but is actually changing into carbon dioxide gas and water vapor</div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="experiment">
            <h3>Experiment 6: Burning Wood and Coal</h3>
            <p>When wood or coal burns, it seems to be destroyed and leaves behind only a small amount of ash. Where does all the matter go?</p>
            <p><strong>What happens:</strong> During combustion, the carbon in the wood or coal combines with oxygen from the air to form carbon dioxide gas, while hydrogen combines with oxygen to form water vapor. Other elements form various gases and solid ash.</p>
            <p><strong>The evidence:</strong> If you could capture all gases released during burning and weigh them along with the ash, the total weight would equal the original wood or coal plus the oxygen used in the reaction.</p>
            
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="conservation_of_matter_log_burning.jpg" alt="Burning log">
                <div class="image-caption">A burning log converts most of its mass into gases that escape into the air</div>
            </div>

                <div class="image-caption">Burning coal changes form but conserves its matter through the reaction with oxygen</div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>When something burns, matter is not destroyed! It changes form, often into gases that we cannot see. The total mass of all products equals the total mass of all reactants.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="experiment">
            <h3>Experiment 7: Baking a Cake</h3>
            <p>When you bake a cake, it rises and gets bigger. Is new matter being created?</p>
            <p><strong>What happens:</strong> Baking powder or yeast in the batter produces carbon dioxide gas. These gas bubbles expand when heated, making the cake rise and appear larger.</p>
            <p><strong>The evidence:</strong> Although the cake looks larger, it hasn't gained mass. If you weigh all ingredients before baking and weigh the cake afterward, the cake will actually weigh slightly less (due to some water evaporating). No new matter was created—the cake just expanded due to gas bubbles!</p>
            
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="baking_cake_in_oven.jpg" alt="Cake baking in an oven">
                <div class="image-caption">A cake rising in the oven - the increased volume comes from expanding gas bubbles, not creation of new matter</div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Testing Conservation of Matter</h2>
        <p>Scientists test the Law of Conservation of Matter by carefully weighing materials before and after a change occurs. Here's how:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Weigh all materials involved before the change</li>
            <li>Make sure to use a closed system if gases might be produced (to capture everything)</li>
            <li>Weigh everything after the change</li>
            <li>Compare the before and after weights—they should be the same!</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>If weights before and after don't match exactly in an experiment, it usually means some matter escaped (often as a gas) and wasn't measured—not that matter was created or destroyed!</p>
        </div>

            <li>Matter is anything that has weight and takes up space.</li>
            <li>The Law of Conservation of Matter states that matter cannot be created or destroyed; it can only change form.</li>
            <li>When substances dissolve, they're still there even if you can't see them.</li>

            <li>During chemical reactions, new substances form, but the total amount of matter stays the same.</li>
            <li>In an open system, matter may seem to disappear because gases can escape, but in a closed system, the total weight remains constant.</li>
            <li>Weighing substances before and after a change is a good way to demonstrate conservation of matter.</li>
