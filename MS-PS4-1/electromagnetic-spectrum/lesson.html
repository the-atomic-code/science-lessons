        <h1>The Electromagnetic Spectrum: Waves of Energy</h1>
        
        <h2>Introduction to Waves and Energy</h2>
        <p>Waves are fascinating phenomena that surround us in our daily lives. Unlike the movement of matter, waves represent the transfer of energy through a repeating pattern. Think of a stadium wave where fans stand up and sit down - the wave moves around the stadium, but the fans stay in their seats. This illustrates a key concept: waves transfer energy, not matter.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <p>Wave definition: A repeating pattern that transfers energy from place to place without transferring matter.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Key Characteristics of Waves</h3>
        <p>All waves, including electromagnetic waves, can be described by three main characteristics:</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="wavelength_amplitude.jpg" alt="Diagram showing wavelength and amplitude of a wave">
            <p class="caption">Diagram showing wavelength and amplitude of a wave. The amplitude is the height from the resting position, while wavelength is the distance between consecutive peaks.</p>
        </div>
        
        <ul>
            <li><span class="key-term">Amplitude</span>: The height of a wave from its resting point. Larger amplitude means more energy is being transferred.</li>
            <li><span class="key-term">Wavelength</span>: The distance from one wave peak to the next peak (or from any point on the wave to the corresponding point on the next wave).</li>
            <li><span class="key-term">Frequency</span>: The number of waves that pass a given point in one second, measured in Hertz (Hz).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="higher_lower_frequency_waves.jpg" alt="Comparison of high and low frequency waves">
            <p class="caption">Comparison of high frequency (top) and low frequency (bottom) waves. Note how high frequency waves have more cycles per unit of distance.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="activity">
            <h3>Think About It:</h3>
            <p>Imagine two sound waves - one from a whisper and one from a shout. Which would have the larger amplitude? The shout would have a larger amplitude because it transfers more energy to your ears, resulting in a louder sound.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>The Mathematical Relationship of Wave Properties</h3>
        <p>Wave properties are mathematically related in important ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Energy is proportional to the square of amplitude. This means that if you double the amplitude of a wave, you quadruple the energy it transfers!</li>
            <li>Wavelength and frequency are inversely related. When wavelength increases, frequency decreases, and vice versa.</li>
            <li>Higher frequency waves transfer more energy in a given time period than lower frequency waves.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="check-understanding">
            <h3>Quick Check:</h3>
            <p>If a wave's amplitude is tripled, how does its energy change?</p>
            <p>Answer: The energy increases by a factor of 9 (3Â²), because energy is proportional to the square of amplitude.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>The Electromagnetic Spectrum</h2>
        <p>Electromagnetic radiation is a type of wave that transfers energy through oscillating electric and magnetic fields. What makes the electromagnetic spectrum so fascinating is its incredible range - from radio waves with wavelengths as long as buildings to gamma rays with wavelengths smaller than an atom's nucleus.</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="electromagnetic_spectrum.jpg" alt="The electromagnetic spectrum showing different types of waves">
            <p class="caption">The electromagnetic spectrum, showing the progression from long wavelength, low-energy radio waves to short wavelength, high-energy gamma rays.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="fun-fact">
            <p>All electromagnetic waves travel at the same speed in a vacuum - the speed of light (approximately 300,000,000 meters per second)! This is the fastest speed possible in our universe.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>The Seven Regions of the Electromagnetic Spectrum</h3>
        <p>Though the electromagnetic spectrum is continuous, scientists typically divide it into seven main regions based on wavelength and frequency:</p>

            </tr>

        <h3>The Pattern of Energy in the Electromagnetic Spectrum</h3>
        <p>As we move from radio waves to gamma rays:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wavelength decreases</li>
            <li>Frequency increases</li>
            <li>Energy increases</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="check-understanding">
            <h3>Quick Check:</h3>
            <p>Which has more energy: an X-ray or a microwave? Why?</p>
            <p>Answer: An X-ray has more energy because it has a higher frequency and shorter wavelength than a microwave.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Detailed Look at Each Type of Electromagnetic Wave</h2>
        
        <h3>Radio Waves: The Giants of the Spectrum</h3>
        <p>Radio waves have wavelengths that range from a few millimeters to hundreds of kilometers, making them the longest waves in the electromagnetic spectrum. Despite their size, these waves play a crucial role in our daily communications.</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="CellularTower_RadioFrequencyTransmission.jpg" alt="Cellular tower transmitting radio waves">
            <p class="caption">Cellular towers transmit and receive radio waves, allowing for mobile communication across large distances.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Key features of radio waves:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>They can pass through walls and buildings, allowing wireless communication inside structures</li>
            <li>They can be blocked by Faraday cages (special metal enclosures that block electromagnetic fields)</li>
            <li>Applications include AM/FM radio, television broadcasts, WiFi signals, mobile phone communications, and satellite transmissions</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="fun-fact">
            <p>The longest radio waves (Extremely Low Frequency) can penetrate seawater and are used to communicate with submarines deep below the ocean's surface!</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Microwaves: Cooking with Waves</h3>
        <p>Microwaves have wavelengths ranging from about 1 millimeter to 1 meter. They have enough energy to cause water molecules to vibrate rapidly but not enough to cause chemical changes in food.</p>
        
        <p>How microwaves heat food:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Microwaves at a specific frequency (usually 2.45 GHz) cause water molecules to vibrate</li>
            <li>This vibration creates friction between molecules</li>
            <li>Friction generates heat energy</li>
            <li>The heat is transferred throughout the food</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>This is why foods with high water content heat quickly in a microwave, while dry foods like crackers heat much more slowly. It also explains why ceramic and plastic containers don't get as hot as the food inside them - they contain very little water!</p>
        
        <h3>Infrared Waves: Feeling the Heat</h3>
        <p>Infrared waves have wavelengths from about 700 nanometers to 1 millimeter. They're often associated with heat because they're emitted by all objects above absolute zero temperature.</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="Thermal_Infrared_Face_Temperature_Map.jpg" alt="Thermal infrared image of a face">
            <p class="caption">A thermal infrared image showing heat patterns on a human face. Different colors represent different temperatures.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Key features of infrared waves:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Thermal imaging cameras detect infrared waves to create "heat pictures"</li>
            <li>Remote controls use infrared to send signals to TVs and other devices</li>
            <li>The heat you feel from a fire or the sun is largely infrared radiation</li>
            <li>Night vision goggles detect infrared to see in the dark</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Visible Light: The Colors We See</h3>
        <p>Visible light is the only part of the electromagnetic spectrum that human eyes can detect. It ranges from about 400 to 700 nanometers in wavelength.</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="light-reflected-transmitted-absorbed.jpg" alt="Light being reflected, transmitted, and absorbed">
            <p class="caption">Light can be reflected, transmitted, or absorbed when it interacts with matter. These interactions determine what colors we see.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>The colors of visible light, from longest wavelength (lowest energy) to shortest wavelength (highest energy):</p>
        <ol>
            <li><span style="color: red;">Red</span> (longest wavelength, lowest energy)</li>
            <li><span style="color: orange;">Orange</span></li>
            <li><span style="color: yellow;">Yellow</span></li>
            <li><span style="color: green;">Green</span></li>
            <li><span style="color: blue;">Blue</span></li>
            <li><span style="color: indigo;">Indigo</span></li>
            <li><span style="color: violet;">Violet</span> (shortest wavelength, highest energy)</li>
        </ol>
        
        <div class="fun-fact">
            <p>White light is actually a mixture of all visible light wavelengths. When white light passes through a prism or water droplets, it separates into the colors of the rainbow!</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Ultraviolet (UV) Light: Beyond Violet</h3>
        <p>Ultraviolet light has wavelengths from about 10 to 400 nanometers, just beyond the violet end of visible light (hence "ultra-violet").</p>
        
        <p>Key facts about UV light:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Sun is a major source of UV radiation</li>
            <li>UV light can damage DNA in skin cells, leading to sunburn and potentially skin cancer</li>
            <li>Sunscreen works by absorbing or reflecting UV radiation</li>
            <li>Some animals, like bees, can see UV light, helping them find nectar in flowers</li>
            <li>UV light can cause fluorescence, making certain materials glow in the dark</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>X-rays: Seeing Inside</h3>
        <p>X-rays have wavelengths from about 0.01 to 10 nanometers, giving them enough energy to pass through soft tissues but not denser materials like bone.</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="x-ray_of_hands.jpg" alt="X-ray image of human hands">
            <p class="caption">X-ray image of human hands showing bone structure. X-rays pass through soft tissue but are absorbed by denser bone material.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Applications of X-rays:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Medical imaging of bones and teeth</li>
            <li>Airport security scanners</li>
            <li>Analyzing crystal structures</li>
            <li>Studying distant cosmic objects like black holes</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <p>X-rays can pass through soft tissue but are absorbed by bones because bones contain calcium, a denser element that absorbs more of the X-ray energy than the lighter elements in soft tissue. This difference in absorption creates the contrast we see in X-ray images.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Gamma Rays: The Most Powerful Waves</h3>
        <p>Gamma rays have wavelengths less than 0.01 nanometers, making them the shortest and most energetic electromagnetic waves.</p>
        
        <p>Key facts about gamma rays:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>They're produced by radioactive decay and nuclear reactions</li>
            <li>They can penetrate most materials, requiring thick lead or concrete for shielding</li>
            <li>They can be detected by Geiger counters</li>
            <li>They're used in cancer treatments to target and destroy cancer cells</li>
            <li>They can sterilize medical equipment by killing bacteria</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="fun-fact">
            <p>Gamma-ray bursts from distant galaxies are the most energetic events observed in the universe, releasing more energy in a few seconds than our Sun will emit in its entire lifetime!</p>
