    <h1>The Electromagnetic Spectrum: Waves of Energy</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction to Waves and Energy</h2>
    
    <p>Have you ever wondered how your phone receives text messages, or how doctors can see inside your body without surgery? The answer lies in understanding the electromagnetic spectrum - a fascinating range of energy waves that permeate our universe and make modern technology possible.</p>

    <div class="info-box">
        <h3>What are Waves?</h3>
        <p>Waves are repeating patterns that transfer energy from one place to another without transferring matter. Think of fans doing "the wave" in a stadium - people stand up and sit down in sequence, creating a wave pattern, but nobody leaves their seat!</p>
        <p>Examples include sound waves, water waves, and electromagnetic waves.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Key Wave Characteristics</h3>
    <p>To understand the electromagnetic spectrum, we first need to understand three key properties of all waves:</p>

    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="wavelength_amplitude.jpg" alt="Diagram showing wavelength and amplitude of a wave">
        <p class="caption">Figure 1: Wavelength measures the distance between wave peaks, while amplitude measures the height of the wave from its resting position.</p>
    </div>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Amplitude:</strong> The height of a wave from its resting point. Larger amplitude means more energy is being transferred. For example, louder sound waves have larger amplitude than quieter ones.</li>
        <li><strong>Wavelength:</strong> The distance from one wave peak to the next peak (or trough to trough).</li>
        <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> How many complete waves pass a given point in one second, measured in Hertz (Hz). For example, a wave passing a point three times in one second has a frequency of 3 Hz.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="higher_lower_frequency_waves.jpg" alt="Comparison of high and low frequency waves">
        <p class="caption">Figure 2: Higher frequency waves (top) have more waves passing a point in a given time than lower frequency waves (bottom).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example">
        <h3>Important Relationship: Wavelength and Frequency</h3>
        <p>Wavelength and frequency have an inverse relationship:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When wavelength gets shorter → frequency gets higher</li>
            <li>When wavelength gets longer → frequency gets lower</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is because all electromagnetic waves travel at the same speed (the speed of light) in a vacuum.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-box">
        <h3>Energy and Frequency</h3>
        <p>The frequency of waves is directly related to the amount of energy they transfer:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>High-frequency waves (like gamma rays) transfer more energy</li>
            <li>Low-frequency waves (like radio waves) transfer less energy</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>What Is the Electromagnetic Spectrum?</h2>
    
    <p>Electromagnetic radiation is a type of wave that transfers energy. What makes these waves "electromagnetic" is that they consist of oscillating electric and magnetic fields that travel through space.</p>
    
    <p>The electromagnetic spectrum is the complete range of electromagnetic waves arranged according to their wavelength and frequency. Although the spectrum is continuous, scientists divide it into seven main sections based on wavelength properties and applications.</p>

    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="electromagnetic_spectrum.jpg" alt="The electromagnetic spectrum showing different types of waves from radio to gamma rays">
        <p class="caption">Figure 3: The electromagnetic spectrum ranges from long-wavelength, low-energy radio waves to short-wavelength, high-energy gamma rays.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>The Seven Regions of the Electromagnetic Spectrum</h3>

        <h3>Fun Fact</h3>
        <p>All electromagnetic waves travel at the same speed in a vacuum: 299,792,458 meters per second, commonly known as the speed of light!</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Radio Waves: The Long-Distance Champions</h2>
    
    <p>Radio waves have the longest wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum, ranging from about one millimeter to hundreds of kilometers.</p>

    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="CellularTower_RadioFrequencyTransmission.jpg" alt="Cell tower transmitting radio waves">
        <p class="caption">Figure 4: Cell towers use radio waves to transmit phone calls, text messages, and data across long distances.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Properties of Radio Waves</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Longest wavelengths (can be the length of a ruler or much longer)</li>
        <li>Lowest frequencies (from kilohertz to gigahertz)</li>
        <li>Lowest energy of all electromagnetic waves</li>
        <li>Can travel long distances</li>
        <li>Can penetrate most non-metallic materials like walls, making them ideal for communications</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="example">
        <h3>Applications of Radio Waves</h3>
        <p>Radio waves are used for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>AM/FM radio broadcasts</li>
            <li>Television broadcasts</li>
            <li>WiFi networks</li>
            <li>Mobile phones</li>
            <li>Satellite communications</li>
            <li>Radio astronomy</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="info-box">
        <h3>How Radio Waves Interact with Matter</h3>
        <p>Radio waves can pass through walls and reach inside buildings, which is why your radio or cell phone works indoors. However, they cannot pass through everything. They can be blocked by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Thick metal structures</li>
            <li>Special metal enclosures called Faraday cages</li>
            <li>Some types of dense materials</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is why elevators, tunnels, and some buildings can create "dead zones" for cell phone reception.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Microwaves: Perfect for Cooking and Communication</h2>
    
    <p>Microwaves have shorter wavelengths than radio waves, ranging from less than 1 meter down to about 1 millimeter.</p>
    
    <h3>Properties of Microwaves</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Wavelengths between radio waves and infrared waves</li>
        <li>Higher frequency than radio waves</li>
        <li>More energy than radio waves</li>
        <li>Excellent for transmitting information over medium distances</li>
        <li>Interact strongly with water molecules</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="example">
        <h3>How Microwave Ovens Work</h3>
        <p>Microwave ovens use microwaves with a specific wavelength (usually 12.2 cm) that causes water molecules in food to vibrate rapidly. This molecular vibration creates friction, which produces heat and cooks the food.</p>
        <p>This is why foods with high water content (like vegetables) heat up quickly, while dry foods (like crackers) or non-food items (like plates) heat up much more slowly or not at all.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-box">
        <h3>Applications of Microwaves</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Microwave ovens for cooking and heating food</li>
            <li>Radar systems for detecting aircraft and weather patterns</li>
            <li>Satellite communications</li>
            <li>Wireless LAN (WiFi at 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz)</li>
            <li>Bluetooth devices</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Infrared Waves: Feeling the Heat</h2>
    
    <p>Infrared (IR) waves have wavelengths ranging from about 700 nanometers to 1 millimeter, making them shorter than microwaves but longer than visible light.</p>

    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="Thermal_Infrared_Face_Temperature_Map.jpg" alt="Thermal imaging of a face showing temperature in different colors">
        <p class="caption">Figure 5: Thermal imaging cameras detect infrared radiation emitted by objects, creating visual maps of temperature differences.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Properties of Infrared Waves</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Wavelengths shorter than microwaves, longer than visible light</li>
        <li>Often experienced as heat</li>
        <li>Emitted by all objects above absolute zero temperature</li>
        <li>Can be blocked by opaque objects but pass through some materials that block visible light</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="example">
        <h3>Thermal Imaging</h3>
        <p>Infrared radiation is the basis for thermal imaging cameras. Since all objects with a temperature above absolute zero emit infrared radiation, these cameras can detect this radiation and convert it into visible images. The hotter an object is, the more infrared radiation it emits.</p>
        <p>This technology allows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Firefighters to see through smoke and locate people in burning buildings</li>
            <li>Security systems to detect intruders in the dark</li>
            <li>Doctors to detect inflammation or circulation problems in patients</li>
            <li>Energy auditors to find heat leaks in buildings</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="info-box">
        <h3>Applications of Infrared Waves</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Thermal imaging cameras</li>
            <li>Remote controls for TVs and other electronics</li>
            <li>Heat lamps in restaurants and for physical therapy</li>
            <li>Night vision goggles</li>
            <li>Infrared astronomy to observe celestial objects</li>
            <li>Weather forecasting (detecting cloud patterns)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Visible Light: The Rainbow We See</h2>
    
    <p>Visible light is the narrow band of the electromagnetic spectrum that human eyes can detect, with wavelengths ranging from about 400 to 700 nanometers.</p>

    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="light-reflected-transmitted-absorbed.jpg" alt="Diagram showing how light can be reflected, transmitted, or absorbed by objects">
        <p class="caption">Figure 6: When light encounters an object, it can be reflected, transmitted, or absorbed, determining the color we perceive.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Properties of Visible Light</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The only part of the electromagnetic spectrum we can see with our eyes</li>
        <li>Consists of the colors of the rainbow: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet (ROYGBIV)</li>
        <li>Red light has the longest wavelength (about 700 nm) and lowest energy</li>
        <li>Violet light has the shortest wavelength (about 400 nm) and highest energy</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="example">
        <h3>White Light and Prisms</h3>
        <p>White light is actually a mixture of all colors of visible light. When white light passes through a prism, it separates into a spectrum of colors because different wavelengths of light bend by different amounts when passing through the glass. This phenomenon is called dispersion.</p>
        <p>In nature, we see this same effect when sunlight passes through water droplets in the air, creating a rainbow.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-box">
        <h3>Color and Objects</h3>
        <p>The color we perceive an object to be depends on which wavelengths of light it reflects or transmits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A red apple appears red because it absorbs all other colors of light and reflects mostly red wavelengths</li>
            <li>A white shirt appears white because it reflects all colors of visible light</li>
            <li>A black object appears black because it absorbs almost all visible light and reflects very little</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Ultraviolet (UV) Waves: Beyond Violet</h2>
    
    <p>Ultraviolet (UV) waves have wavelengths shorter than visible light but longer than X-rays, ranging from about 10 to 400 nanometers.</p>
    
    <h3>Properties of UV Waves</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Higher energy than visible light</li>
        <li>Can cause chemical reactions</li>
        <li>Can damage living tissue</li>
        <li>Divided into UVA, UVB, and UVC categories based on wavelength and effects</li>
        <li>Can make certain materials fluoresce (glow)</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="warning">
        <h3>UV Radiation and Health</h3>
        <p>The Sun emits ultraviolet radiation in all wavelength ranges, but our atmosphere filters out most of the shorter wavelengths. Even so, enough UV radiation reaches Earth's surface to pose health risks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>UVB radiation can damage DNA in skin cells, leading to sunburn and possibly skin cancer</li>
            <li>UVA radiation can cause premature aging of the skin and suppress the immune system</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is why sunscreen is important - it contains compounds that absorb or reflect UV radiation before it can damage skin cells.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-box">
        <h3>Applications of UV Waves</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Sterilization (killing bacteria and viruses)</li>
            <li>Black lights that make fluorescent materials glow</li>
            <li>Checking authenticity of documents and currency</li>
            <li>Curing certain adhesives and coatings</li>
            <li>Astronomy (studying high-energy objects)</li>
            <li>Beneficial UVB exposure helps the body produce vitamin D</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>X-rays: Seeing Through Solids</h2>
    
    <p>X-rays have wavelengths ranging from about 0.01 to 10 nanometers, shorter than UV rays but longer than gamma rays.</p>

    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="x-ray_of_hands.jpg" alt="X-ray image of human hands showing bones clearly">
        <p class="caption">Figure 7: X-rays can pass through soft tissues but are absorbed by denser materials like bone, creating clear images of internal structures.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Properties of X-rays</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>High energy, short wavelength</li>
        <li>Can penetrate some materials that block visible light</li>
        <li>Different tissues absorb X-rays to different degrees</li>
        <li>Can ionize atoms (knock electrons off atoms), which can damage living cells</li>
        <li>Require protective shielding in medical and industrial applications</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="example">
        <h3>How X-ray Imaging Works</h3>
        <p>X-rays can pass through soft tissues in the body but are absorbed by denser materials like bone. When X-rays pass through the body onto a detector:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bones appear white (because they absorb most X-rays)</li>
            <li>Soft tissues appear in gray shades</li>
            <li>Air appears black (because X-rays pass through freely)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This difference in absorption is what makes X-rays so useful for medical imaging.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-box">
        <h3>Applications of X-rays</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Medical imaging (radiography, CT scans)</li>
            <li>Airport security scanners</li>
            <li>Industrial inspection of materials</li>
            <li>Astronomy (observing high-energy phenomena)</li>
            <li>Crystallography (determining molecular structures)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="warning">
        <h3>X-ray Safety</h3>
        <p>Because X-rays can damage living tissue, protective measures are important:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lead shields and aprons are used during medical X-rays because lead is very effective at blocking X-rays</li>
            <li>X-ray technicians stand behind protective barriers</li>
            <li>Exposure time is limited to the minimum necessary</li>
            <li>Modern equipment uses the lowest effective dose</li>

    <h2>Gamma Rays: The Highest Energy Waves</h2>
    
    <p>Gamma rays have the shortest wavelengths (less than 0.01 nanometers) and highest frequencies of all electromagnetic waves.</p>
    
    <h3>Properties of Gamma Rays</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Extremely high energy and frequency</li>
        <li>Shortest wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum</li>
        <li>Produced by radioactive materials and nuclear reactions</li>
        <li>Highly penetrating - can pass through many materials</li>
        <li>Strongly ionizing - can severely damage living tissue</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="example">
        <h3>Detecting Gamma Rays</h3>
        <p>Gamma rays are invisible to the human eye and cannot be felt, so special instruments are needed to detect them. The most common device is the Geiger counter, which clicks when it detects radiation. The faster the clicking, the stronger the radiation.</p>

        <h3>Gamma Ray Safety</h3>
        <p>Due to their high energy and penetrating power, gamma rays require significant shielding:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Thick layers of lead or concrete are needed to block gamma rays</li>
            <li>Even several inches of lead may only reduce rather than completely block intense gamma radiation</li>
            <li>Time, distance, and shielding are the key principles for radiation protection</li>
        </ul>

            <th>Electromagnetic Waves</th>
            <th>Mechanical Waves (e.g., Sound)</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Medium required</td>
            <td>No - can travel through vacuum</td>
            <td>Yes - require a medium (solid, liquid, or gas)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Speed in vacuum</td>
            <td>All travel at the speed of light (c)</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>How they transfer energy</td>
            <td>Through electromagnetic fields</td>
            <td>Through physical displacement of particles</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <div class="example">
        <h3>Key Difference</h3>
        <p>The most fundamental difference: Sound waves transfer energy by physically moving particles in a medium, while electromagnetic waves transfer energy through oscillating electric and magnetic fields, requiring no medium.</p>
        <p>This is why sound cannot travel through the vacuum of space, but light from distant stars can reach us!</p>
