        <h2>What is Extreme Weather?</h2>
        <p>Extreme weather refers to any weather conditions that fall outside of normal patterns. These unusual weather events can include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Heavy winds</li>
            <li>Thunderstorms</li>
            <li>Floods</li>
            <li>Heat waves</li>
            <li>Tornadoes</li>
            <li>Hurricanes</li>
            <li>Hail storms</li>
            <li>Blizzards</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="image-container">

            <p class="image-caption">Satellite image of a hurricane. Hurricanes are powerful extreme weather events that can cause significant damage to coastal areas.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Why Is Extreme Weather Important to Understand?</h3>
            <p>Extreme weather can cause significant damage to homes, buildings, and infrastructure. While we can't stop these natural events from happening, we can find ways to reduce their impact through preparation and engineering solutions.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="activity">
            <h3>Think About It!</h3>
            <p>Have you ever experienced extreme weather? What was it like? What did people do to stay safe?</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Predicting Extreme Weather</h2>
        <p>Scientists study weather patterns to help predict when and where extreme weather might occur. By looking at data collected over many years, they can identify patterns that help us prepare.</p>
        
        <div class="fact">
            <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
            <p>Hurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean occurs between June 1st and November 30th each year. People living in coastal areas use this information to prepare before storms arrive.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>While we can predict some types of extreme weather based on seasons and patterns, others like tornadoes can be difficult to predict exactly when and where they will touch down.</p>

            <p class="image-caption">Tornado Alley stretches from Texas to North Dakota and experiences more tornadoes than any other region in the United States.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Weather prediction helps communities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Prepare emergency supplies</li>
            <li>Plan evacuations if necessary</li>
            <li>Secure buildings and property</li>
            <li>Reduce potential damage</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Engineering Solutions for Coastal Flooding</h2>
        <p>Coastal areas face unique challenges during extreme weather, especially from hurricanes and storm surges that can cause flooding. Engineers have developed several solutions to help protect coastal areas:</p>
        
        <h3>Seawalls</h3>
        <p>Seawalls are concrete barriers built along beaches that experience large waves. These physical barriers block water and prevent flooding as water rises during storms.</p>
        
        <h3>Recurved Walls</h3>
        <p>A special type of seawall with a curved surface, recurved walls not only block waves but also redirect wave energy back out toward the ocean. Tests have shown these are particularly effective at reducing flooding.</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="recurved_seawall.jpg" alt="Recurved seawall design">
            <p class="image-caption">A recurved seawall design that deflects wave energy back toward the ocean, providing better protection against coastal flooding.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Elevated Buildings</h3>
        <p>Another approach is to construct buildings on stilts or on top of garages to keep water from entering homes during floods. This allows water to flow underneath without causing damage to living spaces.</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="stilt_house_on_coast.jpg" alt="Houses built on stilts along the coastline">
            <p class="image-caption">Colorful houses built on stilts along a coastline to protect them from flooding during storms and high tides.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Success Criteria for Flood Protection</h3>
            <p>Engineers measure the success of flood protection systems by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Amount of water blocked or diverted</li>
                <li>Reduction in property damage</li>
                <li>Durability during repeated storms</li>
                <li>Cost-effectiveness of the solution</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="activity">
            <h3>Compare and Contrast!</h3>
            <p>Think about the three flood protection methods: seawalls, recurved walls, and elevated buildings. Which do you think might be the most effective? Which might cost the most to build? Which might last the longest?</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Engineering Solutions for High Winds</h2>
        <p>High winds from hurricanes and tornadoes can cause severe damage to buildings, especially roofs. Engineers have studied how different roof designs perform during high winds.</p>
        
        <h3>Gable Roofs vs. Hip Roofs</h3>
        <p><strong>Gable Roofs:</strong> These have sides that are straight up and down, forming an "A" shape. When wind hits a gable roof, it pushes directly against the flat surface, which can cause the roof to lift off during extreme wind events.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Hip Roofs:</strong> These have all sides slanted upward. Instead of the wind pushing directly against a flat surface, it gets deflected upward along the sloped sides. This design has proven more resistant to high winds.</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">

        <div class="fact">
            <h3>Wind Science!</h3>
            <p>Tornado winds can reach speeds up to 300 miles per hour - strong enough to lift cars, destroy homes, and uproot trees.</p>

        </div>
        
        <h3>Safe Rooms</h3>
        <p>Engineers have developed special building panels that can withstand the extreme winds of a tornado. These can be used to create a safe room inside a home. Even if a tornado destroys the rest of the house, people inside the safe room will be protected.</p>

        <h2>Engineering Solutions for Lightning</h2>
        <p>Lightning is a powerful electrical discharge that can damage buildings and electronics. Benjamin Franklin's experiments with lightning led to an important safety invention that we still use today.</p>

            <p class="image-caption">Lightning striking a tall building. Without proper protection, lightning can cause significant damage to structures and electrical systems.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Lightning Rods</h3>
        <p>Lightning rods are metal rods mounted on or near buildings that protect against electrical damage during thunderstorms. Here's how they work:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The metal rod attracts lightning because metal is a good conductor of electricity</li>
            <li>When lightning strikes the rod, the electrical energy travels down through wires</li>
            <li>The energy is directed safely into the ground</li>
            <li>This prevents the electricity from traveling through the building and damaging its structure or electronics</li>
        </ol>
        
        <div class="image-container">

            <p class="image-caption">A lightning rod installed on a roof. This simple but effective device helps protect buildings from lightning damage by safely directing electrical energy to the ground.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Lightning Protection Success Criteria</h3>
            <p>A successful lightning protection system will:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Safely redirect lightning strikes to the ground</li>
                <li>Prevent electrical surges in the building</li>
                <li>Protect electronic devices and appliances</li>
                <li>Reduce fire risk from lightning strikes</li>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Engineering Solutions for Extreme Heat</h2>
        <p>Urban areas often experience higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas due to the "heat island effect." Engineers have developed solutions to help reduce extreme heat impacts:</p>
        
        <h3>Reflective Surfaces</h3>
        <p>Painting roads and rooftops with reflective white paint is one strategy to lower temperatures on paved surfaces. Dark surfaces absorb heat, while light-colored surfaces reflect sunlight back into the atmosphere.</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">

            <p class="image-caption">A street painted with reflective white paint to reduce heat absorption. This simple solution can significantly lower surface temperatures in urban areas during heat waves.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Green Roofs and Urban Trees</h3>
        <p>Plants and trees help cool urban areas through shade and the water they release into the air. Green roofs (roofs covered with plants) can significantly reduce building temperatures.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Engineering Constraints and Considerations</h2>
        <p>When developing solutions for extreme weather, engineers must consider various constraints:</p>
        
        <h3>Common Constraints:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Materials:</strong> Using materials that are strong enough to withstand extreme conditions but also available and affordable</li>
            <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Creating solutions that are financially feasible for communities to implement</li>
            <li><strong>Time:</strong> Developing solutions that can be implemented before the next extreme weather event</li>
            <li><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> Ensuring solutions don't harm local ecosystems</li>
            <li><strong>Space Limitations:</strong> Working within the physical space available in existing communities</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Balancing Act</h3>
            <p>Engineers must balance effectiveness with practicality. For example, a 30-foot seawall might provide excellent flood protection but could be too expensive to build and might block ocean views that residents value.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Testing Engineering Solutions</h2>
        <p>Before implementing solutions in the real world, engineers test their designs to make sure they work effectively.</p>
        
        <h3>Testing Methods:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Scale Models:</strong> Creating small versions of structures to test in simulated conditions</li>
            <li><strong>Computer Simulations:</strong> Using powerful computers to predict how designs will perform</li>
            <li><strong>Material Testing:</strong> Subjecting building materials to extreme conditions to test durability</li>
            <li><strong>Measurement:</strong> Collecting data to quantify performance (e.g., amount of water blocked, wind resistance)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="activity">
            <h3>Design Challenge!</h3>
            <p>How would you test whether a roof design can withstand high winds? What equipment would you need? What measurements would you take to determine if your design is successful?</p>
        </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Evolving Solutions</h2>
        <p>As our understanding of extreme weather grows and as climate patterns change, engineering solutions continue to evolve. New materials and technologies offer improved protection:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Impact-resistant windows that can withstand hurricane-force winds and flying debris</li>
            <li>Flexible building materials that can bend rather than break during earthquakes or high winds</li>

        <h2>Think Like an Engineer!</h2>
        <p>Engineers solve problems by identifying needs, developing possible solutions, and testing their ideas. When it comes to extreme weather, they need to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Define the problem:</strong> What specific weather challenge needs to be addressed?</li>
            <li><strong>Research:</strong> What solutions have been tried before? What worked and what didn't?</li>
            <li><strong>Brainstorm:</strong> What new ideas might work better?</li>
            <li><strong>Design:</strong> Create detailed plans for the solution</li>
            <li><strong>Build and test:</strong> Create models or prototypes to see if the solution works</li>
            <li><strong>Improve:</strong> Make changes based on test results</li>
        </ol>
        
        <div class="activity">
            <h3>Final Challenge: Design Your Own Solution!</h3>
            <p>Imagine you live in an area that experiences frequent flooding during heavy rainstorms. Your challenge is to design a solution that would help protect homes in your neighborhood.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What is your solution?</li>
                <li>What materials would you need?</li>
                <li>How would you test if your solution works?</li>
                <li>What constraints (limitations) might you face?</li>
                <li>How would you measure success?</li>
