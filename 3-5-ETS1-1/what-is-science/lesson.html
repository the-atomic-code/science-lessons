        </div>

        <h2>What is Science?</h2>
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>Science is the process of learning about the natural world through observation and experimentation.</strong> Scientists are like detectives who ask questions about how things work and then find evidence to answer those questions!</p>
        </div>

        </div>

        <div class="important">
            <h3>🌟 Key Point: Evidence is #1 in Science!</h3>
            <p>In science, everything must be backed up by evidence. Scientists don't just guess - they observe, test, and prove their ideas with real data.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>How Scientists Work</h2>
        <p>Real scientists are very organized and methodical. They don't randomly mix chemicals like in movies! Instead, they:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ask meaningful questions that can be tested</li>
            <li>Use specific tools and methods</li>
            <li>Make careful observations</li>
            <li>Record their findings</li>
            <li>Share results with other scientists</li>
            <li>Read about studies by others</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="science-practices">
            <h3>🔧 The Eight Scientific Practices</h3>
            <p>Scientists use these practices to do their work (they don't always use all of them or follow this exact order):</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Asking questions and defining problems</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Developing and using models</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Planning and carrying out investigations</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Analyzing and interpreting data</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Using mathematics and computational thinking</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Constructing explanations</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Engaging in argument from evidence</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information</strong></li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        </div>

        <h2>Scientific Problem-Solving and Design</h2>
        <p>Scientists often need to solve problems and design solutions. When they do this, they must consider several important factors:</p>

        <h3>🎯 Understanding Needs and Wants</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Needs</strong> are things people must have to survive or solve important problems (like clean water, medicine, or tools for research).</p>
            <p><strong>Wants</strong> are things people would like to have but don't absolutely need (like faster computers or more comfortable chairs).</p>
            <p><em>Important:</em> Needs and wants can change over time as technology improves and situations change!</p>
        </div>

        <h3>🚧 Design Constraints</h3>
        <p>Constraints are limitations that scientists and engineers must work within when solving problems:</p>

        <div class="vocabulary">
            <h4>Types of Constraints:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Material Constraints:</strong> What materials are available to use?</li>
                <li><strong>Time Constraints:</strong> How much time do we have to solve the problem?</li>
                <li><strong>Cost Constraints:</strong> How much money can we spend?</li>
                <li><strong>Technology Constraints:</strong> What tools and technology are available?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>✅ Design Criteria</h3>
        <div class="important">
            <p><strong>Criteria</strong> are the requirements that a successful solution must meet. They help us know if our solution actually works!</p>
            <p>For example, if designing a new microscope, the criteria might be: "Must magnify objects at least 100 times" and "Must be lightweight enough for students to carry."</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Simple vs. Complex Design Problems</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Simple problems</strong> have few constraints and clear solutions</li>
            <li><strong>Complex problems</strong> have many constraints and may require considering multiple factors at once</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Solutions Evolve</h2>
        <div class="example-box">
            <h3>🔄 Technology Changes Over Time</h3>
            <p>Technological solutions evolve because human needs change and new materials become available. For example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Early microscopes were simple magnifying glasses</li>
                <li>Modern microscopes can show incredibly tiny details</li>
                <li>Future microscopes might use new technologies we haven't invented yet!</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="vintage_lightbulb_glowing_filament.jpg" alt="Classic incandescent lightbulb with glowing filament">
            <div class="image-caption">The development of electricity and lighting technology shows how scientific discoveries lead to practical solutions that improve people's lives</div>
        </div>

        <h3>🛠️ Improving Existing Tools</h3>
        <p>Sometimes we improve existing tools rather than creating completely new ones. Improvements might include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Making tools more accurate</li>
            <li>Making them easier to use</li>
            <li>Making them less expensive</li>
            <li>Making them work faster</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Evidence and Scientific Theories</h2>
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h3>📊 The More Evidence, The More Confident We Are</h3>
            <p>When scientists collect lots of data that supports a hypothesis, it may become a theory. Theories are tested continuously, and sometimes they change when new evidence is found!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="important">
            <h3>🧠 Scientists Must Be Open-Minded</h3>
            <p>Scientists must always be willing to change their minds when new evidence appears. For centuries, people believed Earth was flat - until scientists found evidence proving it was round!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="comparison-container">
            <div class="comparison-item">
                <img src="flat_earth.jpg" alt="Artistic representation of the flat Earth theory">
                <h4>Old Belief: Flat Earth</h4>
                <p>For centuries, people believed the Earth was flat because that's how it appeared to them.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="comparison-item">
                <img src="earth_and_space.jpg" alt="Earth viewed from space showing its spherical shape">
                <h4>Scientific Evidence: Round Earth</h4>
                <p>Through careful observation and evidence, scientists proved the Earth is actually spherical.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>What is NOT Science?</h2>
        <p>Many things around us appear to be science but are not:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Palm reading</strong> - no evidence supports the claims</li>
            <li><strong>Magic tricks</strong> - designed to fool people, not find truth</li>
            <li><strong>Predicting the future with magic</strong> - no evidence it works</li>
            <li><strong>Astrology</strong> - claims that star positions affect human behavior, but there's no evidence for this</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="magic_8_ball.jpg" alt="Black magic 8-ball fortune telling toy">
            <div class="image-caption">Fortune telling devices like magic 8-balls are not science because they make claims without any evidence to support them</div>
        </div>

        <div class="vocabulary">
            <p><strong>Remember:</strong> Astronomy (studying space) IS science. Astrology (claiming stars affect human behavior) is NOT science because there's no evidence to support it.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Real-World Applications</h2>
        <div class="example-box">
            <h3>🌾 Agriculture</h3>
            <p>Scientists have revolutionized farming by developing better seeds, fertilizers, and farming methods. They had to consider constraints like climate, soil type, and cost while meeting the criteria of producing more food.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="image-container">

        </div>

        <h2>Multiple Solutions to Problems</h2>
        <div class="important">
            <h3>🤔 Why Might Multiple Solutions Exist?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Different constraints lead to different solutions</li>
                <li>Some solutions work better in certain situations</li>
                <li>Available resources vary in different places</li>
                <li>People may have different priorities for what criteria are most important</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Evaluating Solutions</h2>
        <p>To determine if a solution is successful, scientists ask:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Does it meet the basic needs of users?</li>
            <li>Does it satisfy the design criteria?</li>
            <li>Does it work within the given constraints?</li>
            <li>Is it better than existing solutions?</li>
            <li>Can it be improved further?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Science as Teamwork</h2>
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>Science is a team effort! Many scientists work together over long periods to solve problems and understand the world. Each scientist builds on the work of others, sharing discoveries and improving solutions over time.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Key Vocabulary Review</h2>
