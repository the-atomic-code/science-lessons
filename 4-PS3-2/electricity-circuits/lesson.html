            <h2>What is Electricity?</h2>
            <p>Electricity is the flow of electrical energy from one place to another. It's what powers our lights, computers, phones, and countless other devices we use every day. But for electricity to work, it needs a path to flow through.</p>

            </div>
            
            <div class="fun-fact">
                <h3>Fun Fact!</h3>
                <p>The word "electricity" comes from the Greek word "elektron," which means amber. Ancient Greeks discovered that when amber was rubbed with fur, it attracted small objects - this was one of the first observations of electrical energy!</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Understanding Circuits</h2>
            <p>A <span class="highlight">circuit</span> is a path that allows electricity to flow. For electricity to flow, the circuit must be <span class="highlight">closed</span> - meaning it forms a complete loop with no gaps anywhere in the path. If there's a gap in the circuit, the electricity cannot flow.</p>
            
            <div class="image-container">

                <p class="image-caption">Left: An open circuit with a gap where electricity cannot flow. Right: A closed circuit where electricity flows completely around the loop.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>Think of a circuit like a circular race track. The electrical energy is like the race cars that need to go around the complete track. If there's a break in the track, the cars can't continue their journey!</p>
            
            <div class="check-understanding">
                <h3>Quick Check:</h3>
                <p>What happens if a circuit has a gap in it?</p>
                <p><em>Answer: If a circuit has a gap, the electricity cannot flow through it because the path is not complete.</em></p>
            </div>
            
            <p>A circuit usually consists of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A power source (like a battery)</li>
                <li>Conductive materials (usually wires)</li>
                <li>Components (like light bulbs, motors, or speakers)</li>
                <li>A switch (to turn the circuit on and off)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Conductors vs. Insulators</h2>
            <p>For electricity to flow, it needs materials that allow it to move easily. These materials fall into two categories:</p>
            
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="conductors_insulators.jpg" alt="Examples of conductors and insulators">
                <p class="image-caption">Various materials showing conductors (metals, water solutions) and insulators (plastic, wood, glass)</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="vocabulary">
                <h3>Conductors</h3>
                <p>Materials that allow electricity to flow through them easily. Examples include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Metals (copper, aluminum, silver, gold)</li>
                    <li>Water (especially when it contains dissolved salts)</li>
                    <li>The human body (which contains salt water)</li>
                    <li>Even a pickle! (because it contains salt water)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="vocabulary">
                <h3>Insulators</h3>
                <p>Materials that do not allow electricity to flow through them easily. Examples include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wood</li>
                    <li>Rubber</li>
                    <li>Plastic</li>
                    <li>Glass</li>
                    <li>Ceramics</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <p>This is why electrical wires are usually made of copper (a conductor) covered with plastic (an insulator). The copper allows electricity to flow, while the plastic covering prevents the electricity from escaping the wire or giving you a shock!</p>
            
            <div class="activity">
                <h3>Think About It!</h3>
                <p>Look around your home. Can you identify five conductors and five insulators?</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Types of Circuits: Series and Parallel</h2>
            
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="series_parallel_circuits.jpg" alt="Series and parallel circuit diagrams">
                <p class="image-caption">Comparison of series circuit (top) and parallel circuit (bottom) arrangements</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Series Circuits</h3>
            <p>In a <span class="highlight">series circuit</span>, all components are connected in a single path. The electricity flows through each component one after another in a single line.</p>
            
            <p>Key characteristics of series circuits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>When you turn on the circuit, all components (like lights) turn on at the same time</li>
                <li>If one component fails or breaks, the entire circuit stops working</li>
                <li>The current is the same throughout the circuit</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Real-world example:</strong> Holiday lights are often wired in series. That's why when one bulb burns out, the entire string of lights goes out! This happens because the broken bulb creates a gap in the circuit, and electricity cannot flow past that point.</p>
            
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="series_lights_for_decoration.jpg" alt="Holiday lights wired in series">
                <p class="image-caption">Holiday lights are a common example of series circuits in everyday life</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Parallel Circuits</h3>
            <p>In a <span class="highlight">parallel circuit</span>, components are connected along multiple paths. Each component has its own separate path from the power source.</p>
            
            <p>Key characteristics of parallel circuits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each component can be turned on or off independently</li>
                <li>If one component fails, the others continue to work</li>
                <li>Each path can have a different amount of current</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Real-world example:</strong> The electrical wiring in your home is arranged in parallel circuits. That's why when a light bulb burns out in the kitchen, the lights in your bedroom still work!</p>
            
            <div class="check-understanding">
                <h3>Quick Check:</h3>
                <p>If you have five light bulbs in a series circuit and one burns out, what happens to the other bulbs?</p>
                <p><em>Answer: All the lights go out because the circuit is broken at the burnt-out bulb.</em></p>
                <p>If you have five light bulbs in a parallel circuit and one burns out, what happens to the other bulbs?</p>
                <p><em>Answer: The other bulbs remain lit because each has its own complete path for electricity.</em></p>

        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Circuit Components</h2>
            <p>Circuits can have many different components that control how electricity flows. Here are some important ones:</p>
            
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="circuit-board-components.jpg" alt="Circuit board with various components">
                <p class="image-caption">A modern circuit board containing various electronic components</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="image-container">

                <p class="image-caption">Examples of different active and passive components used in electronic circuits</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Resistors</h3>
            <p>A <span class="highlight">resistor</span> reduces the amount of electricity flowing through a circuit. The more resistors you add, the less current flows, and the dimmer a light bulb would be. They help control the flow of electricity.</p>
            
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="resistor.jpg" alt="A resistor component">
                <p class="image-caption">A resistor component with color bands indicating its resistance value</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Potentiometers</h3>
            <p>A <span class="highlight">potentiometer</span> is an adjustable resistor. It allows you to control how much electricity flows by turning a knob or moving a slider. Volume controls on radios and brightness controls on lamps often use potentiometers.</p>
            
            <h3>Diodes</h3>
            <p>A <span class="highlight">diode</span> allows electricity to flow in only one direction. This is important in many devices because it prevents electricity from flowing backward, which could damage components. Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) are special diodes that produce light when electricity flows through them.</p>
            
            <h3>Fuses</h3>
            <p>A <span class="highlight">fuse</span> is a safety device that breaks the circuit if too much current flows. This prevents fires and damage to other components. If too much current flows, the fuse "blows" (breaks), creating a gap in the circuit.</p>
            
            <h3>Switches</h3>
            <p>A <span class="highlight">switch</span> simply opens or closes a circuit, turning the flow of electricity on or off. When you flip a light switch, you're completing or breaking a circuit.</p>
            
            <h3>Integrated Circuits (ICs)</h3>
            <p><span class="highlight">Integrated circuits</span> are tiny packages that contain many components (resistors, transistors, capacitors, etc.) in a very small space. These have revolutionized electronics by allowing complex circuits to fit in small devices. Your smartphone contains millions of components on integrated circuits!</p>
            
            <h3>Transistors</h3>
            <p>A <span class="highlight">transistor</span> can amplify electrical signals or act as a switch. They're fundamental to computers and most modern electronics.</p>
            
            <h3>Capacitors</h3>
            <p>A <span class="highlight">capacitor</span> stores electrical energy temporarily and can release it quickly when needed.</p>
            
            <div class="fun-fact">
                <h3>Amazing Fact!</h3>
                <p>The first computer, ENIAC, built in the 1940s, filled an entire room and weighed 30 tons! Today, we have much more powerful computers that fit in our pockets, thanks to integrated circuits that pack millions of components into tiny spaces.</p>

        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Understanding Voltage</h2>
            <p><span class="highlight">Voltage</span> is a measure of potential energy between two points in a circuit or in a battery. It's like the electrical "pressure" that pushes electricity through a circuit.</p>
            
            <p>Batteries have different voltages:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A typical AA battery is 1.5 volts</li>
                <li>A 9-volt battery is (you guessed it!) 9 volts</li>
                <li>A car battery is about 12 volts</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Higher voltage means more electrical potential energy, which can make lights brighter or motors spin faster. But devices are designed to work with specific voltages - using too high a voltage can damage them!</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Controlling Energy in Circuits</h2>
            
            <h3>How to Control the Brightness of a Light Bulb</h3>
            <p>There are several ways to control how bright a light bulb shines in a circuit:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Change the voltage</strong>: Using a higher voltage battery will make the bulb brighter; a lower voltage will make it dimmer</li>
                <li><strong>Add resistors</strong>: Adding more resistors reduces the current, making the bulb dimmer</li>
                <li><strong>Use a potentiometer</strong>: By adjusting the potentiometer (like a dimmer switch), you can control exactly how bright the bulb is</li>
                <li><strong>Use a transistor</strong>: Transistors can adjust how much current flows to the bulb</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>How to Control the Speed of a Motor</h3>
            <p>Similarly, you can control how fast a motor spins using the same principles:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Change the voltage</strong>: Higher voltage makes the motor spin faster</li>
                <li><strong>Add resistors</strong>: More resistance slows the motor down</li>
                <li><strong>Use a potentiometer</strong>: Allows precise control of motor speed</li>
                <li><strong>Use a transistor</strong>: Can control the power going to the motor</li>
            </ol>
            
            <div class="check-understanding">
                <h3>Quick Check:</h3>
                <p>If you want to make a light bulb dimmer, which of these would work?</p>
                <p><em>Answer: Add more resistors to the circuit, use a lower voltage battery, or adjust a potentiometer to increase resistance.</em></p>

            <h2>Energy Transformation in Circuits</h2>
            <p>Electrical energy can be transformed into other forms of energy in a circuit:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Light</strong>: In light bulbs and LEDs, electrical energy becomes light energy</li>
                <li><strong>Heat</strong>: Toasters and electric heaters convert electrical energy to heat</li>
                <li><strong>Motion</strong>: Motors convert electrical energy to mechanical energy (movement)</li>
                <li><strong>Sound</strong>: Speakers convert electrical energy to sound energy</li>
            </ul>

                <h3>Think About It!</h3>
                <p>Name three devices in your home that transform electrical energy into at least two different forms of energy. (For example, a hair dryer converts electricity into both heat and mechanical energy for the fan.)</p>

            <h3>Electronic Devices</h3>
            <p>Electrical engineers design circuits for smartphones, computers, video games, televisions, and many other devices we use daily. Advancements in circuit design have made these devices smaller, faster, and more energy-efficient over time.</p>
            
            <h3>Power Grids</h3>
            <p>Electrical engineers design, maintain, and troubleshoot the large power grids that deliver electricity to our homes and businesses. These complex systems ensure power flows safely and efficiently.</p>
            
            <h3>Medical Technology</h3>
            <p>One of the most exciting applications is in medical technology, especially prosthetics. Modern prosthetic limbs use tiny circuits to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Control movements based on muscle signals</li>
                <li>Power motors that move joints</li>
                <li>Create "electronic skin" that allows users to feel touch, pressure, and temperature</li>

            <p>This means someone with a prosthetic hand can not only pick up objects but actually feel what they're touching, thanks to electrical circuits that convert touch sensations into electrical signals the brain can interpret.</p>

                <h3>Amazing Innovation!</h3>
                <p>Some advanced prosthetic limbs can now detect signals from remaining muscles and translate them into movement. When the user thinks about moving their hand, electrical signals from their muscles are detected by circuits in the prosthetic, which then move accordingly!</p>

            <h2>Summary: Key Points to Remember</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Electricity</strong> is the flow of electrical energy from one place to another</li>
                <li>A <strong>circuit</strong> is a path that allows electricity to flow, and it must be closed (no gaps)</li>
                <li><strong>Conductors</strong> allow electricity to flow easily (metals, water with dissolved salts)</li>
                <li><strong>Insulators</strong> prevent electricity from flowing (wood, rubber, plastic)</li>
                <li>In <strong>series circuits</strong>, components are arranged in a single path; if one fails, the whole circuit fails</li>
                <li>In <strong>parallel circuits</strong>, components have separate paths; if one fails, others still work</li>
                <li><strong>Resistors</strong> reduce the amount of electricity flowing in a circuit</li>
                <li><strong>Diodes</strong> allow electricity to flow in only one direction</li>
                <li><strong>Voltage</strong> measures the potential energy that pushes electricity through a circuit</li>
                <li><strong>Integrated circuits</strong> pack many components into small spaces, making modern electronics possible</li>
                <li>Electrical energy can transform into light, heat, motion, and sound</li>
            </ul>

                <h3>Final Check:</h3>
                <p>1. What do you need for electricity to flow?</p>
                <p><em>Answer: A closed circuit with no gaps, made of conductive materials.</em></p>
                
                <p>2. Why do holiday lights often all go out when one bulb burns out?</p>
                <p><em>Answer: Because they're arranged in a series circuit, where one broken component breaks the entire path.</em></p>
                
                <p>3. How has circuit technology improved prosthetics?</p>
                <p><em>Answer: Circuits allow prosthetics to convert muscle signals into movement and provide sensory feedback, letting users feel touch and control the prosthetic limb more naturally.</em></p>
