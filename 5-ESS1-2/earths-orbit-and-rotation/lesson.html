    <h1>Earth's Orbit and Rotation: Our Planet in Motion</h1>
    <h2>Introduction: Earth's Two Major Movements</h2>
<p>Our amazing planet Earth is constantly in motion! It moves in two different ways simultaneously:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Rotation:</strong> Earth spins around its axis (an imaginary line running from the North Pole to the South Pole) once every 24 hours.</li>
    <li><strong>Orbit:</strong> Earth travels in a path around the Sun, completing one full orbit every 365.25 days.</li>
</ol>

<div class="image-container">
    <img src="earth_orbiting_around_sun.jpg" alt="Earth orbiting around the sun">
    <p class="caption">Earth follows an elliptical path as it orbits around the Sun while simultaneously rotating on its axis.</p>
</div>

<p>These two movements happening at the same time create many fascinating patterns that we can observe in our daily lives, including day and night, changing seasons, and the different stars we see throughout the year.</p>

<div class="activity">
    <h3>Quick Activity: Feel the Spin!</h3>
    <p>Stand up and spin around once in place. This is similar to Earth's rotation! Now, while still spinning, walk in a large circle around an object (like a chair). This is like Earth orbiting the Sun while rotating!</p>
</div>

<h2>Earth's Rotation: Spinning on its Axis</h2>
<p>Earth rotates (spins) on its axis once every 24 hours, or one day. This rotation is what gives us day and night. When the part of Earth where you live faces toward the Sun, it's daytime. When your part of Earth rotates away from the Sun, it's nighttime.</p>

<div class="image-container">
    <img src="rotation_of_earth_on_its_axis.jpg" alt="Earth rotating on its axis">
    <p class="caption">Earth rotates on its axis, which is an imaginary line running from the North Pole to the South Pole.</p>
</div>

<div class="key-concept">
    <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Earth's rotation is counterclockwise when viewed from above the North Pole. It rotates at about 1,000 miles per hour (1,600 km/h) at the equator!</p>
</div>

<p>Although it might seem like the Sun is moving across the sky during the day, it's actually Earth's rotation that creates this appearance. The Sun isn't moving around us - we're spinning!</p>

<div class="image-container">
    <img src="earths_rotation_causes_day_night.jpg" alt="Earth's rotation causing day and night">
    <p class="caption">As Earth rotates, half the planet experiences daylight while the other half experiences night.</p>
</div>

<div class="fun-fact">
    <h3>Fun Fact: Proving Earth's Rotation</h3>
    <p>In 1851, a French physicist named Léon Foucault created a special pendulum (now called a Foucault pendulum) that provided visual evidence of Earth's rotation. The pendulum consists of a heavy weight hanging from a long wire that swings back and forth. If Earth weren't rotating, the pendulum would always swing in the same direction. However, over time, the pendulum appears to change direction because the Earth is rotating beneath it! Many science museums have Foucault pendulums on display.</p>
</div>

<div class="image-container">
    <img src="pendulum_to_prove_earths_rotation.jpg" alt="Foucault pendulum demonstrating Earth's rotation">
    <p class="caption">A Foucault pendulum demonstrates Earth's rotation as the pendulum appears to change its swing direction while the Earth rotates beneath it.</p>
</div>

<h2>Effects of Earth's Rotation</h2>
<h3>1. Day and Night Cycle</h3>
<p>As Earth rotates, only half of the planet faces the Sun at any given time. This half experiences daylight and is warmer. The other half, facing away from the Sun, experiences night and is cooler. Every location on Earth passes through both day and night during each 24-hour rotation.</p>

<h3>2. Changing Shadow Patterns</h3>
<p>Shadows change in length and direction throughout the day due to Earth's rotation. In the morning, when the Sun appears low in the eastern sky, shadows are long and point westward. At noon, when the Sun is highest in the sky, shadows are at their shortest. In the afternoon, as the Sun appears to move toward the western horizon, shadows lengthen again and point eastward.</p>

<div class="activity">
    <h3>Shadow Investigation</h3>
    <p>On a sunny day, place a stick upright in the ground and mark the tip of its shadow with a rock every hour from morning to afternoon. Notice how the shadow's length and direction change throughout the day. These changes occur because of Earth's rotation!</p>
</div>

<h3>3. Time Zones</h3>
<p>Since Earth rotates and different parts of the planet experience day and night at different times, we've divided the world into 24 time zones (one for each hour in a day). Without time zones, 9:00 AM would be morning in some places but night in others! Time zones help coordinate time across the globe so that morning, afternoon, and evening occur at appropriate times relative to daylight hours in each region.</p>

    <p class="caption">Earth is divided into 24 time zones to account for different locations experiencing daylight at different times due to Earth's rotation.</p>

    <img src="USA_timezones.jpg" alt="Time zones across the United States">
    <p class="caption">The United States spans multiple time zones, from Eastern Time on the east coast to Hawaii-Aleutian Time in the Pacific.</p>
</div>

<h2>Earth's Orbit: Journey Around the Sun</h2>
<p>While Earth is rotating on its axis, it's also traveling in a nearly circular path around the Sun. This path is called Earth's orbit. It takes Earth exactly 365.25 days (or about 365 days and 6 hours) to complete one orbit around the Sun.</p>

<div class="image-container">
    <img src="earths_orbit_around_sun_takes_365.25days.jpg" alt="Earth's orbit around the sun takes 365.25 days">
    <p class="caption">Earth completes one full orbit around the Sun in 365.25 days, traveling at an average speed of 67,000 miles per hour.</p>
</div>

<div class="key-concept">
    <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Earth travels at an average speed of 67,000 miles per hour (107,000 km/h) in its orbit around the Sun!</p>
</div>

<h3>The Calendar and Leap Years</h3>
<p>Our calendar normally has 365 days in a year, but Earth's actual orbital period is 365.25 days. To account for this extra quarter day, we add one extra day (February 29) to our calendar every four years. This is called a leap year.</p>

<div class="image-container">
    <img src="February-Calendar-Leap-Year-29-Days.jpg" alt="February calendar showing 29 days in a leap year">
    <p class="caption">During leap years, February has 29 days instead of the usual 28 to account for Earth's 365.25-day orbital period.</p>
</div>

<div class="think-about">
    <p><strong>Think about it:</strong> Why add a leap day every 4 years? Because 4 years × 0.25 days = 1 day. Without leap years, our calendar would slowly drift out of alignment with Earth's orbit around the Sun!</p>
</div>

<h3>Other Planets' Orbits</h3>
<p>Each planet in our solar system has its own orbital period:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Mercury: 88 Earth days</li>
    <li>Venus: 225 Earth days</li>
    <li>Earth: 365.25 Earth days</li>
    <li>Mars: 687 Earth days</li>
    <li>Jupiter: 12 Earth years</li>
    <li>Saturn: 29 Earth years</li>
    <li>Uranus: 84 Earth years</li>
    <li>Neptune: 165 Earth years</li>
</ul>

<h2>Effects of Earth's Orbit</h2>
<h3>1. Changing Constellations</h3>
<p>As Earth orbits the Sun, our night sky view changes throughout the year. Different constellations (recognizable patterns of stars) are visible during different seasons because we're looking out into space from different positions in our orbit. For example, Orion is easily visible in winter evenings but not in summer from the Northern Hemisphere.</p>

<div class="image-container">
    <img src="earths_orbit_causes_changing_night_sky.jpg" alt="Earth's orbit causes changing night sky views">
    <p class="caption">As Earth orbits the Sun, our view of the night sky changes, making different constellations visible during different seasons.</p>
</div>

<div class="activity">
    <h3>Constellation Tracker</h3>
    <p>Create a "constellation calendar" by observing and recording which star patterns you can see each month. After a year, you'll notice that certain constellations are only visible during specific times of the year due to Earth's position in its orbit.</p>
</div>

<h3>2. Stellar Parallax</h3>
<p>Stellar parallax is the apparent shift in position of nearby stars when viewed from different points in Earth's orbit. This phenomenon provides important evidence that Earth orbits the Sun rather than staying stationary. Ancient astronomers couldn't detect stellar parallax because they lacked precise instruments, which led them to incorrectly believe Earth was stationary.</p>

<div class="fun-fact">
    <h3>Historical Perspective: Geocentric vs. Heliocentric Models</h3>
    <p>For thousands of years, many civilizations believed in a geocentric model of the universe, where Earth was thought to be the center with everything orbiting around it. This seemed logical because the Sun appears to move across our sky each day. In the 16th century, astronomers like Nicolaus Copernicus and later Galileo Galilei challenged this view with the heliocentric model, correctly placing the Sun at the center with Earth and other planets orbiting around it. Observations like stellar parallax later confirmed the heliocentric model.</p>

<h2>Review Questions</h2>

<div class="question">1. How long does it take Earth to complete one rotation on its axis?</div>
<p>Earth completes one full rotation on its axis every 24 hours, which gives us our day-night cycle.</p>

<div class="question">2. Why do we experience day and night on Earth?</div>
<p>Day and night occur because Earth rotates on its axis. The side of Earth facing the Sun experiences daylight, while the side facing away from the Sun experiences night.</p>

<div class="question">3. How long does it take Earth to complete one orbit around the Sun?</div>
<p>Earth takes exactly 365.25 days (or about 365 days and 6 hours) to complete one full orbit around the Sun.</p>

<div class="question">4. Why do we have leap years with an extra day every four years?</div>
<p>We add an extra day (February 29) every four years because Earth's orbital period is 365.25 days, not exactly 365 days. Four quarter-days (0.25 × 4) add up to one full day, which keeps our calendar aligned with Earth's orbit.</p>

<div class="question">5. How do shadows change throughout the day, and why?</div>
<p>Shadows are longest in the morning and afternoon, and shortest at noon. This happens because of Earth's rotation, which changes the apparent position of the Sun in our sky throughout the day.</p>

<div class="question">6. What is a Foucault pendulum and what does it demonstrate?</div>
<p>A Foucault pendulum is a scientific instrument consisting of a heavy weight hanging from a long wire that swings back and forth. It demonstrates Earth's rotation because the pendulum appears to change its swinging direction over time as Earth rotates beneath it.</p>

<div class="question">7. Why are there 24 time zones on Earth?</div>
<p>Earth is divided into 24 time zones (one for each hour in a day) to ensure that morning, afternoon, and evening occur at appropriate times relative to daylight hours in each region as Earth rotates.</p>

<div class="question">8. Why do we see different constellations during different seasons of the year?</div>
<p>We see different constellations during different seasons because Earth's position in its orbit around the Sun changes throughout the year, giving us different views of the night sky in different directions.</p>

<div class="question">9. What is stellar parallax and what does it prove?</div>
<p>Stellar parallax is the apparent change in position of nearby stars when viewed from different points in Earth's orbit. It provides evidence that Earth orbits the Sun rather than remaining stationary.</p>

<div class="question">10. What was the geocentric model of the universe and why did people believe it for so long?</div>
<p>The geocentric model incorrectly placed Earth at the center of the universe with everything orbiting around it. People believed this model for thousands of years because it matched their everyday observations of the Sun appearing to move across the sky.</p>

<div class="activity">
    <h3>Final Challenge: Earth's Movements Journal</h3>
    <p>Keep a journal for one week where you record:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The exact time of sunrise and sunset each day</li>
        <li>The length and direction of a shadow at three different times each day</li>
        <li>Any constellations or bright stars you can identify in the evening</li>
    </ul>
    <p>After the week, analyze your data to identify patterns related to Earth's rotation and orbit!</p>
</div>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Earth's rotation and orbit create the fundamental rhythms of our lives—from the daily cycle of light and darkness to the changing seasons and star patterns throughout the year. Understanding these movements helps us make sense of many natural phenomena we observe every day. The next time you watch a sunrise, observe your shadow changing throughout the day, or gaze at the stars on a clear night, remember that these experiences are all connected to our planet's continuous motion through space!</p>
