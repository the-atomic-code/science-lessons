    <h1>The Magic of Chemical Reactions: The Bouncy Egg Experiment</h1>
    
    <p>Have you ever wondered how scientists can transform ordinary substances into something completely different? Today, we're going to explore the fascinating world of chemical reactions by turning a regular, fragile egg into a bouncy, rubbery ball that you can actually (gently) bounce!</p>
    
    <div class="science-note">
        <h3>What is a Chemical Reaction?</h3>
        <p>A chemical reaction is a process where atoms rearrange themselves to form new substances with different properties. In a chemical reaction, the substances you start with (called reactants) are transformed into new substances (called products). The most important thing to remember is that atoms are never created or destroyed in a chemical reaction - they just get rearranged!</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>The Bouncy Egg Experiment</h2>
    
    <p>In this experiment, we'll create a chemical reaction between vinegar and an eggshell to transform a regular egg into something with completely different properties!</p>
    
    <div class="experiment-box">
        <h3>Materials Needed:</h3>
        <ul class="materials">
            <li>1 uncooked egg</li>
            <li>1 cup of vinegar</li>
            <li>1 jar (large enough to hold the egg)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Let's Get Started!</h3>
        <ul class="steps">
            <li>Fill up the jar with vinegar, enough to completely submerge the egg.</li>
            <li>Carefully place the egg in the jar of vinegar.</li>
            <li>Watch for a few minutes - you'll see bubbles starting to form on the surface of the egg. This is a sign that our chemical reaction is starting!</li>
            <li>Leave the egg in the jar overnight (or about 24 hours).</li>
            <li>Carefully remove the egg from the vinegar and gently rinse it with water.</li>
            <li>After drying the egg, you can carefully squeeze it, shine a light through it, or even carefully bounce it from a very low height!</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h2>The Science Behind the Magic</h2>
    
    <p>This experiment isn't just a cool trick - it's a perfect example of a chemical reaction happening right before your eyes!</p>
    
    <h3>What's Happening:</h3>
    <p>Eggshells are made of calcium carbonate (CaCO₃), which is the same chemical found in seashells, limestone, and chalk. Vinegar contains acetic acid. When these two chemicals meet, they react! The acetic acid in the vinegar breaks down the calcium carbonate in the eggshell.</p>
    
    <p>The chemical reaction looks something like this:</p>
    <p><strong>Calcium Carbonate + Acetic Acid → Calcium Acetate + Water + Carbon Dioxide</strong></p>
    
    <p>The bubbles you see forming on the egg are carbon dioxide gas - one of the products of this reaction. The calcium acetate dissolves in the water, effectively removing the shell. What remains is the egg's membrane, which is flexible and gives the egg its new bouncy property!</p>
    
    <div class="science-note">
        <h3>Conservation of Matter in Action</h3>
        <p>Remember the Law of Conservation of Matter? It states that the total number of atoms before and after a chemical reaction always stays the same. In our experiment, every atom from the calcium carbonate and acetic acid can be accounted for in the products: calcium acetate, water, and carbon dioxide. No atoms were created or destroyed - they just rearranged to form new substances!</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Properties Before and After</h2>
    
    <p>Let's compare the properties of our egg before and after the chemical reaction:</p>
    
    <table border="1" style="width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 20px 0;">
        <tr style="background-color: #FF8C00; color: white;">
            <th style="padding: 8px; text-align: left;">Property</th>
            <th style="padding: 8px; text-align: left;">Before Reaction</th>
            <th style="padding: 8px; text-align: left;">After Reaction</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">Texture</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">Hard, rigid</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">Soft, flexible</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">Appearance</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">Opaque white shell</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">Translucent (light can pass through)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">Strength</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">Brittle, breaks easily</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">Rubbery, can be compressed</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">Ability to bounce</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">None (shatters)</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">Can bounce from a small height</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    
    <h2>Chemical Reactions vs. Physical Changes</h2>
    
    <p>It's important to understand the difference between chemical reactions and physical changes:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chemical Reactions:</strong> Form new substances with different properties (like our egg experiment)</li>
        <li><strong>Physical Changes:</strong> Change the state or appearance of a substance but do not create new substances (like melting ice)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="science-note">
        <h3>Is Dissolving a Chemical or Physical Change?</h3>
        <p>Many people think dissolving is just a physical change, but it can sometimes involve chemical reactions. In our experiment, the eggshell didn't just dissolve - it actually reacted with the vinegar to form completely new substances!</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Check Your Understanding</h2>
    
    <div class="question">1. Why do bubbles form on the egg when you place it in vinegar?</div>
    <div class="answer">Bubbles form because the chemical reaction between the calcium carbonate in the eggshell and the acetic acid in vinegar produces carbon dioxide gas. These bubbles are the carbon dioxide escaping from the reaction.</div>
    
    <div class="question">2. What happened to the mass of the original eggshell? Did it disappear?</div>
    <div class="answer">The mass didn't disappear! According to the Law of Conservation of Matter, matter cannot be created or destroyed in chemical reactions. The calcium from the eggshell is now part of the calcium acetate dissolved in the solution, while the carbon and some oxygen atoms were released as carbon dioxide gas.</div>
    
    <div class="question">3. Why is the egg bouncy after the reaction?</div>
    <div class="answer">The egg becomes bouncy because the hard calcium carbonate shell has been removed, leaving only the flexible membrane that naturally exists inside the eggshell. This membrane is elastic and gives the egg its new bouncy property.</div>
    
    <div class="question">4. Is this a chemical reaction or a physical change? How do you know?</div>
    <div class="answer">This is definitely a chemical reaction because new substances are formed. The calcium carbonate and acetic acid react to produce calcium acetate, water, and carbon dioxide - all different substances with different properties from the original reactants. The bubbles (carbon dioxide) and the complete change in properties also indicate a chemical reaction has occurred.</div>
    
    <div class="question">5. What might happen if you left the egg in the vinegar for several days instead of just overnight?</div>
    <div class="answer">If you left the egg in vinegar for too long, the acid might start to break down the membrane as well, causing the egg to leak or burst. The chemical reaction with the shell would be complete after about 24-48 hours, so extra time wouldn't make the egg more bouncy - it might actually destroy it!</div>
    
    <h2>Real-World Applications</h2>
    
    <p>Scientists and engineers use chemical reactions like this every day to create new materials and solve problems. Some examples include:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Pharmaceutical chemists creating medicines</li>
        <li>Food scientists developing new food products</li>
        <li>Environmental engineers creating solutions for cleaning polluted water</li>
        <li>Materials scientists developing new plastics, metals, and other materials</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The next time you see bubbles forming, a color change, or feel heat being produced, remember - you might be witnessing a chemical reaction where atoms are rearranging themselves to form entirely new substances!</p>
    
    <h2>Extension Challenge</h2>
    
    <p>Try experimenting with different liquids instead of vinegar (like water, soda, or orange juice) and observe whether similar reactions occur. Record your observations and explain whether each liquid created a chemical reaction with the eggshell. What properties of the liquids might be responsible for causing or not causing a reaction?</p>
    
    <div class="science-note">
        <h3>Safety Note</h3>
        <p>While this experiment is safe, remember to always wash your hands after handling raw eggs, as they can contain bacteria. Also, don't eat the bouncy egg - it's for science, not snacking!</p>
