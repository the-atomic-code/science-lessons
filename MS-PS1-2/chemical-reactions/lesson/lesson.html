        <p class="image-caption">A spectacular display of color changes during a chemical reaction, indicating the formation of new substances</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="info-box">
        <p>Welcome to our exciting journey into the world of chemical reactions! In this lesson, we'll discover how substances transform into new materials with different properties, explore the difference between chemical and physical changes, and learn about the conservation of matter during reactions.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>What is a Chemical Reaction?</h2>
    
    <p>A <span class="highlight">chemical reaction</span> is a process in which new substances are formed. During this process, the atoms you start with rearrange themselves to form new substances with different properties. The key point to remember is that the number of atoms before and after a chemical reaction always stays the same.</p>
    
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="reactants_rearrange_to_form_products_water_example.jpg" alt="Diagram showing hydrogen and oxygen atoms rearranging to form water molecules">
        <p class="image-caption">Reactants (hydrogen and oxygen) rearrange their atoms to form products (water) in a chemical reaction</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="example-box">
        <p><strong>Think about it:</strong> When you burn wood in a campfire, the wood seems to disappear. But what's actually happening? The atoms in the wood are rearranging and combining with oxygen from the air to form new substances like carbon dioxide and water vapor. The wood hasn't vanished—its atoms have just rearranged!</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Properties Change in Chemical Reactions</h2>
    
    <p>All matter has properties that can be observed and measured. These properties help us identify substances and predict how they might interact with other materials.</p>
    
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="properties_of_matter.jpg" alt="Various properties of matter illustrated including magnetism, flammability, density and odor">
        <p class="image-caption">Properties of matter can be observed, recorded, and tested to identify substances</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>There are two main types of properties:</p>
    
    <div class="two-column">
        <div class="column">
            <h3>Physical Properties</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Color</li>
                <li>Density</li>
                <li>Melting/boiling points</li>
                <li>State (solid, liquid, gas)</li>
                <li>Solubility</li>
                <li>Malleability/Ductility</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="physical_properties_of_matter.jpg" alt="Physical properties of matter illustrated">
        </div>
        <div class="column">
            <h3>Chemical Properties</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Flammability</li>
                <li>Reactivity with water/acids</li>
                <li>Oxidation (rusting)</li>
                <li>Combustibility</li>
                <li>Toxicity</li>
                <li>Acidity/Basicity</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="physical_vs_chemical_properties_of_matter.jpg" alt="Comparison of physical and chemical properties of matter">
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <p>When a chemical reaction occurs, the properties of the substances change because new substances with different properties are formed.</p>
    
    <div class="activity-box">
        <h3>Detecting a Chemical Reaction</h3>
        <p>How can we tell if a chemical reaction has occurred? We can test the properties before and after the suspected reaction!</p>
        <p>For example, if we test steel wool (which is mostly iron):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Before reaction: Steel wool is gray, attracted to magnets, and can burn when ignited.</li>
            <li>After reaction with oxygen: The resulting iron oxide (rust) is reddish-brown, still somewhat attracted to magnets, but no longer flammable.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The changes in these properties tell us that a chemical reaction has taken place and a new substance has formed.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conservation of Matter: Atoms Don't Disappear</h2>
    
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Law of Conservation of Matter</span> states that matter cannot be created or destroyed in chemical reactions. This means that the total number of atoms before a reaction equals the total number after the reaction. Atoms simply rearrange themselves to form new substances.</p>
    
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="conservation_of_mass.jpg" alt="Illustration showing that total mass remains the same before and after a chemical reaction">
        <p class="image-caption">The Law of Conservation of Matter: The total mass before a reaction equals the total mass after the reaction</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="info-box">
        <p>If you measure the mass of all reactants before a chemical reaction and the mass of all products after the reaction (making sure to capture any gases formed), you'll find that the total mass remains exactly the same!</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Here's how atoms rearrange in a chemical reaction:</p>
    
    <div class="chemical-equation">
        4Fe + 3O<sub>2</sub> → 2Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
    </div>
    
    <p>In this reaction, iron (Fe) combines with oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) to form iron oxide (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). Notice that the number of iron atoms (4) and oxygen atoms (6) is the same on both sides of the equation. The atoms have just rearranged to form a new substance.</p>
    
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="atoms_rearrange_in_forming_water.jpg" alt="Molecular diagram showing how hydrogen and oxygen atoms rearrange to form water">
        <p class="image-caption">Atoms rearrange during chemical reactions while maintaining the same total number</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Reactants and Products</h2>
    
    <p>In chemical reactions, we use specific terms to describe the substances involved:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Reactants</span>: The starting substances that undergo the chemical reaction</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Products</span>: The new substances formed as a result of the reaction</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="example-box">
        <p>Let's look at a common reaction - the combustion of propane in a gas grill:</p>
        <div class="chemical-equation">
            C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub> + 5O<sub>2</sub> → 3CO<sub>2</sub> + 4H<sub>2</sub>O
        </div>
        <p><strong>Reactants:</strong> Propane (C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>) and oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>)</p>
        <p><strong>Products:</strong> Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and water (H<sub>2</sub>O)</p>
        <p>Count the atoms on each side: 3 carbon atoms, 8 hydrogen atoms, and 10 oxygen atoms. The same number appears on both sides of the equation, but they're arranged differently to form new substances with different properties.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Chemical Changes vs. Physical Changes</h2>
    
    <p>Not all changes in matter involve chemical reactions. It's important to distinguish between chemical and physical changes:</p>
    
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="chemical_vs_physical_changes_comparison.jpg" alt="Comparison between chemical and physical changes">

            <td>No new substances form</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Chemical properties change</td>
            <td>Physical properties may change, but chemical properties remain the same</td>
        </tr>

            <td>Usually easily reversible</td>
        </tr>

            <td>Examples: burning, rusting, cooking</td>
            <td>Examples: melting, freezing, boiling, breaking</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    
    <div class="image-container">

        <p class="image-caption">Examples of chemical changes (like burning) and physical changes (like melting ice)</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="info-box">
        <p><strong>Important clarification:</strong> Many students think dissolving is a physical change, but it often involves chemical reactions! When a substance dissolves, it can break down or interact with the solvent, which can involve breaking and forming chemical bonds. This makes dissolving a chemical change in many cases.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="activity-box">
        <h3>Is It Physical or Chemical?</h3>
        <p>For each change, decide if it's physical or chemical:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Ice melting into water (Physical - same H<sub>2</sub>O molecules, just arranged differently)</li>
            <li>A piece of paper burning (Chemical - new substances form, including carbon dioxide and water)</li>
            <li>Breaking a glass (Physical - same substance, just in smaller pieces)</li>
            <li>Milk souring (Chemical - bacteria convert lactose into lactic acid, creating new substances)</li>
            <li>Boiling water (Physical - water molecules remain H<sub>2</sub>O, just farther apart)</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <h2>Molecules: Building Blocks of Substances</h2>
    
    <p><span class="highlight">Molecules</span> are formed when two or more atoms join together through chemical bonds. For example, oxygen gas (O<sub>2</sub>) consists of two oxygen atoms bonded together. Water (H<sub>2</sub>O) is a molecule made of two hydrogen atoms bonded to one oxygen atom.</p>
    
    <p>During chemical reactions, molecules interact with each other, and their atoms rearrange to form new molecules with different properties. The specific arrangement of atoms in molecules determines the properties of substances.</p>
    
    <div class="check-understanding">
        <h3>Check Your Understanding:</h3>
        <p>What makes these two substances different?</p>
        <p>- Oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>): a colorless, odorless gas necessary for breathing</p>
        <p>- Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>): a bluish gas with a sharp odor that can be harmful to breathe</p>
        <p>Both are made of only oxygen atoms, but they have different properties because of how the atoms are arranged in their molecules!</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Catalysts: Speeding Up Reactions</h2>
    
    <p>A <span class="highlight">catalyst</span> is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without being consumed in the reaction. Catalysts work by providing an alternative pathway for the reaction that requires less energy.</p>
    
    <div class="info-box">
        <p>An important fact about catalysts: they help reactions happen faster, but they don't become part of the final products. After the reaction, you can recover the catalyst unchanged.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Examples of catalysts include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Enzymes in your body that help break down food</li>
        <li>Platinum in catalytic converters that help reduce harmful emissions</li>
        <li>Manganese dioxide used to speed up the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Evidence of Chemical Reactions</h2>
    
    <p>How can we tell when a chemical reaction has occurred? Here are some common signs:</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Color change:</strong> A change in color often indicates new substances have formed.</li>
        <li><strong>Production of gas:</strong> Bubbles or fizzing can indicate gas formation.</li>
        <li><strong>Formation of a precipitate:</strong> A solid forming in a liquid solution.</li>
        <li><strong>Temperature change:</strong> Heat being released (exothermic) or absorbed (endothermic).</li>
        <li><strong>Light production:</strong> Light being emitted during the reaction.</li>
        <li><strong>Change in properties:</strong> Changes in flammability, magnetism, electrical conductivity, etc.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <div class="example-box">
        <h3>Example: Baking Soda and Vinegar</h3>
        <p>When baking soda (sodium bicarbonate, NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) and vinegar (acetic acid, CH<sub>3</sub>COOH) are mixed, we observe:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bubbling and fizzing (CO<sub>2</sub> gas forms)</li>
            <li>The mixture feels cold (the reaction is endothermic)</li>
            <li>The pH changes (properties change)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These observations indicate that a chemical reaction has occurred, producing new substances with different properties.</p>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>Chemical reactions are processes where atoms rearrange to form new substances with different properties. The Law of Conservation of Matter ensures that atoms are neither created nor destroyed during reactions—they simply rearrange. Chemical changes result in new substances forming, while physical changes only alter the appearance or state of a substance without creating something new.</p>
        <p>By testing properties like flammability, magnetism, conductivity, and odor, we can determine if a chemical reaction has occurred. Understanding chemical reactions helps us make sense of the world around us and is crucial for many scientific and technological advances.</p>
