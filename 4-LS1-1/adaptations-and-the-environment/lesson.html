    <h1>Animal Adaptations and the Environment</h1>
    
    <div class="container">
        <h2>What Are Adaptations?</h2>
        <p>An <span class="vocab-term">adaptation</span> is a characteristic of a living thing that helps it survive in its environment. All living things, from tiny insects to giant whales and even humans, have adaptations that have developed over many generations.</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="colorful_bird_perched.jpg" alt="Colorful bird with adaptations for its environment">
            <p class="image-caption">This colorful bird has adaptations that help it survive in its specific environment</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="info-box">
            <p><strong>Key Point:</strong> Adaptations are all about survival! They help animals find food, protect themselves from predators, and thrive in their specific environments.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Animals can develop adaptations when their environment changes. These changes might happen:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Quickly due to natural disasters</li>
            <li>Slowly over thousands of years</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>When environments change, animals have three main options:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Some animals die if they can't adapt</li>
            <li>Some animals move to a new location</li>
            <li>Some animals develop new adaptations over many generations to help them survive</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    
    <div class="container">
        <h2>The Environment</h2>
        <p>An <span class="vocab-term">environment</span> includes everything living and non-living in the area where a plant or animal lives. For example, a giraffe's environment includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Living things: trees, grass, other animals</li>
            <li>Non-living things: water, soil, rocks, air</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="giraffe.jpg" alt="Giraffe in its natural environment">
            <p class="image-caption">A giraffe in its natural environment, which includes both living and non-living elements</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="info-box">
            <p>Animals develop adaptations specifically suited to their environment. A desert animal will have different adaptations than a rainforest animal because they face different challenges!</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Types of Adaptations</h2>
        
        <p>Animals have different types of adaptations that help them survive:</p>
        
        <div class="comparison">
            <div class="comparison-column">
                <h3>Physical Adaptations</h3>
                <p>These are body structures that help an animal survive.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A giraffe's long neck</li>
                    <li>An armadillo's armor plates</li>
                    <li>A hummingbird's long beak</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="comparison-column">
                <h3>Behavioral Adaptations</h3>
                <p>These are actions animals take to survive.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A sloth moving slowly</li>
                    <li>An armadillo rolling into a ball</li>
                    <li>A deer running quickly</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="info-box">
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> Most animals use a combination of physical AND behavioral adaptations working together as a system to survive.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Adaptations for Protection</h2>
        
        <p>Many animals have adaptations that protect them from predators. These adaptations can be physical structures, behaviors, or both working together as a system.</p>
        
        <h3>The Amazing Armadillo</h3>
        <p>The <span class="vocab-term">armadillo</span> has two key adaptations that work together for protection:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Physical adaptation:</strong> Tough "armored" plates made of bone covering its body</li>
            <li><strong>Behavioral adaptation:</strong> The ability to roll into a tight ball when threatened</li>
        </ol>
        <p>When these adaptations work together, the armadillo creates an effective defense system. The bony plates protect its back while rolling into a ball protects its soft underside.</p>
        
        <h3>The Stealthy Sloth</h3>
        <p>The <span class="vocab-term">sloth</span> uses multiple adaptations that work as a system for protection:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Behavioral adaptation:</strong> Moving extremely slowly through trees makes them difficult to spot</li>
            <li><strong>Physical adaptation:</strong> Long, hairy bodies with algae growing on them provide camouflage</li>
            <li><strong>Physical adaptation:</strong> Long arms and strong claws for hanging from trees, keeping them away from ground predators</li>
        </ol>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="sloth_climbing_tree.jpg" alt="Sloth climbing slowly on a tree">
            <p class="image-caption">A sloth's slow movement and camouflage are adaptations that help it avoid predators</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>These adaptations work together perfectly - the slow movement and algae-covered fur create excellent camouflage, making sloths nearly invisible to predators in the trees.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <h4>More Protection Adaptations</h4>
            <p><strong>Lizards:</strong> Many lizards have detachable tails that snap off when a predator grabs them. The tail continues to wiggle, distracting the predator while the lizard escapes. This combination of physical structure (detachable tail) and escape behavior works together as an effective defense system.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="activity">
            <h4>Think About It:</h4>
            <p>Which do you think is more effective - the armadillo's armor plates and ball-rolling behavior or the lizard's detachable tail and escape behavior? Why?</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Adaptations for Finding Food</h2>
        
        <p>Different animals have specialized structures and behaviors that help them find and obtain food in their environment.</p>
        
        <h3>Bird Beak Adaptations</h3>
        <p>Birds have evolved a variety of specialized beaks that function differently depending on what they eat:</p>
        
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Bird</th>
                <th>Beak Adaptation</th>
                <th>Function</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Hummingbird</td>
                <td>Long, thin beak + ability to hover</td>
                <td>Reaches deep into flowers to drink nectar that other birds cannot access</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Pelican</td>
                <td>Large pouch-like beak</td>
                <td>Scoops up water containing fish, then drains the water to trap the fish</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Hawk</td>
                <td>Strong, hooked beak</td>
                <td>Tears apart prey animals</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="hummingbird_on_flower.jpg" alt="Hummingbird feeding from a flower">
            <p class="image-caption">A hummingbird using its specialized beak and hovering ability to drink nectar from a flower</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="info-box">
            <p><strong>Key Point:</strong> The hummingbird's adaptations give it a competitive advantage. Because of its long beak and hovering ability working together as a system, it can access nectar that other birds cannot reach. This means it doesn't have to compete with most other birds for food.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>The Versatile Giraffe</h3>
        <p>Giraffes have multiple adaptations that function together as a system for feeding:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Long neck:</strong> Allows them to reach leaves high in trees that other animals cannot reach</li>
            <li><strong>Long tongue (16-18 inches):</strong> Helps pull leaves from branches while avoiding thorns</li>
            <li><strong>Dark-colored tongue tip:</strong> Protects the tongue from sunburn when extended for long periods</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These adaptations work together as a coordinated system - the long neck gets the giraffe to the right height, the long tongue allows it to grab leaves from thorny branches, and the dark tip protects it from sun damage during feeding.</p>
        
        <h3>The Amazing Echidna</h3>
        <p>Echidnas found in Australian deserts have multiple adaptations that work together as a system for finding and eating ants and termites:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Elongated nose:</strong> Senses electrical movements created by ants and termites</li>
            <li><strong>Long, sticky tongue:</strong> Extends into ant and termite mounds to collect insects</li>
            <li><strong>Large, powerful feet:</strong> Used for digging to access ant nests and to bury themselves to keep cool</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This system of adaptations allows echidnas to thrive in harsh desert environments where food is difficult to find.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Sensory Adaptations</h2>
        
        <p>Many animals have enhanced senses that help them find food, detect predators, or navigate their environment.</p>
        
        <h3>Dogs vs. Cats: Different Sensory Adaptations</h3>
        
        <div class="comparison">

        <div class="example">
            <h4>Specialized Sensing</h4>
            <p>The echidna can sense electrical signals produced by the movements of ants and termites. This is similar to how sharks can detect electrical fields produced by fish hiding nearby. These sensory adaptations allow animals to find food that would otherwise be hidden.</p>

    </div>
    
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Movement Adaptations</h2>

        <div class="comparison">
            <div class="comparison-column">
                <h4>Speed Adaptations</h4>

            </div>
            <div class="comparison-column">
                <h4>Slow Movement Adaptations</h4>
                <p><strong>Sloths:</strong> Move extremely slowly through the trees</p>
                <p>This slow movement is actually an adaptation that helps them avoid being seen by predators and conserves energy.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="info-box">
            <p>Different movement speeds serve different purposes in survival! Speed helps some animals escape predators, while slow movement helps others avoid being detected in the first place.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Camouflage Adaptations</h2>
        
        <p>Camouflage is an adaptation that helps animals blend in with their surroundings to avoid being seen by predators or prey.</p>
        
        <h3>Sloth Camouflage System</h3>
        <p>Sloths have a fascinating camouflage system that involves multiple adaptations working together:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Their fur has grooves that collect rainwater where algae can grow</li>
            <li>The green algae makes them blend in with the leaves in the trees</li>
            <li>Their slow movement prevents them from standing out against the background</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This system makes sloths nearly invisible to predators like eagles and jaguars that might be looking for them in the treetops.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="container">
        <h2>How Multiple Adaptations Work Together</h2>
        
        <p>Most animals have several adaptations that function together as a system to help them survive. Let's look at some examples:</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <h4>The Armadillo's Defense System</h4>
            <p>When threatened, an armadillo's adaptations work together:</p>

        <h2>Environmental Changes and Adaptations</h2>
        
        <p>When environments change, animals must adapt, move, or they may not survive. Environmental changes can happen:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Quickly:</strong> Natural disasters like floods, fires, or volcanic eruptions</li>
            <li><strong>Slowly:</strong> Climate changes over thousands of years</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Adaptations develop over many generations through natural selection. Animals with helpful traits are more likely to survive and pass those traits to their offspring.</p>
        
        <div class="info-box">
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> Individual animals don't develop new adaptations during their lifetime. Instead, populations change over many generations as animals with helpful traits have more offspring.</p>
