    <h1>Amazing Animal Adaptations: External Parts and Survival</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>What Are External Animal Parts?</h2>
        <p>External parts of an animal are any parts located on the outside of its body. These include legs, tails, claws, skin, feathers, fur, scales, beaks, and shells. These external structures aren't just there by chance—they serve important purposes that help animals survive in their environments.</p>
        
        <div class="fun-fact">
            <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Every external part of an animal has evolved over time to help that animal survive in its specific habitat!</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Legs: Moving Through the World</h2>
        <p>Animals have different numbers of legs depending on their species:</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="tarantula_spider.jpg" alt="A tarantula spider showing its eight legs">
            <p class="caption">A tarantula with eight legs. Spiders use their legs for precise movement when building webs and capturing prey.</p>
        </div>
        
        <ul>
            <li><span class="key-concept">Spiders</span> have 8 legs, which help them move quickly to capture prey and escape predators</li>
            <li><span class="key-concept">Insects</span> have 6 legs, providing stability and specialized movement</li>
            <li><span class="key-concept">Mammals</span> like dogs, cows, lions, and bears have 4 legs, allowing them to run, walk, and jump</li>
            <li><span class="key-concept">Birds</span> have 2 legs, freeing up their wings for flight</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Legs aren't just for walking! Different animals have specialized legs for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Jumping (like frogs and kangaroos)</li>
            <li>Climbing (like monkeys and squirrels)</li>
            <li>Digging (like moles)</li>
            <li>Swimming (like ducks with webbed feet)</li>
            <li>Running (like cheetahs with long, powerful legs)</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="think-about-it">
            <p><strong>Think About It:</strong> How do the different number of legs on spiders versus insects affect how they move and survive? Why might having 8 legs be advantageous for a spider?</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Claws: Multi-Purpose Tools</h2>
        <p>Many animals have claws, which are hard structures attached to their toes or fingers. Claws serve multiple important functions:</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="armadillo.jpg" alt="An armadillo using its claws to dig in soil">
            <p class="caption">An armadillo uses its powerful claws to dig for insects and grubs in the soil. These specialized claws, combined with its protective shell, help it survive.</p>
        </div>
        
        <ul>
            <li><span class="key-concept">Digging for food:</span> Armadillos use their strong claws to dig for insects and grubs in the soil</li>
            <li><span class="key-concept">Creating homes:</span> Prairie dogs and rabbits dig burrows for shelter</li>
            <li><span class="key-concept">Climbing:</span> Cats can extend their claws to climb trees and other surfaces</li>
            <li><span class="key-concept">Catching prey:</span> Eagles and hawks have sharp talons to grab fish and small mammals</li>
            <li><span class="key-concept">Self-defense:</span> Bears and lions use their claws to protect themselves</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="activity">
            <p><strong>Quick Activity:</strong> Think about three different animals with claws. How does each animal use its claws differently? How do these differences help each animal survive in its specific environment?</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Tails: Balance, Movement, and More</h2>
        <p>Tails are fascinating structures that serve many different purposes depending on the animal:</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="monkey_using_tail_to_hang_from_tree.jpg" alt="A monkey hanging from a tree branch using its prehensile tail">
            <p class="caption">This monkey demonstrates how a prehensile tail functions like a fifth limb, allowing it to hang securely while keeping its hands free for collecting food or moving through the canopy.</p>
        </div>
        
        <ul>
            <li><span class="key-concept">Prehensile tails:</span> Monkeys use their tails like an extra arm to hang from trees, keeping their hands free for gathering food or swinging from branch to branch</li>
            <li><span class="key-concept">Balance:</span> Cats use their tails to balance when walking on narrow surfaces</li>
            <li><span class="key-concept">Swimming:</span> Fish use their tails to propel themselves through water</li>
            <li><span class="key-concept">Communication:</span> Dogs communicate emotions through tail positions and movements</li>
            <li><span class="key-concept">Defense:</span> Some lizards can detach their tails when captured by predators. While the predator is distracted by the still-moving tail, the lizard escapes!</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="fun-fact">
            <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> A lizard that loses its tail can often grow a new one, though the replacement may look different from the original!</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Animal Coverings: Protection, Warmth, and Camouflage</h2>
        <p>Animals have a variety of external coverings that serve as their first line of defense against the environment:</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="cockatoo.jpg" alt="A white cockatoo with its feathers and beak visible">
            <p class="caption">This cockatoo's feathers provide insulation, enable flight, and display bright colors. Its specialized beak allows it to crack open nuts and seeds.</p>
        </div>
        
        <ul>
            <li><span class="key-concept">Skin:</span> Humans and many other animals have skin, which provides a barrier against infections and helps regulate temperature</li>
            <li><span class="key-concept">Fur:</span> Mammals like polar bears have fur that keeps them warm in cold environments</li>
            <li><span class="key-concept">Feathers:</span> Birds have feathers that enable flight, provide insulation, and sometimes attract mates with bright colors</li>
            <li><span class="key-concept">Scales:</span> Fish and reptiles have scales that offer protection while allowing movement</li>
            <li><span class="key-concept">Shells:</span> Crabs, turtles, and snails have hard shells that protect their soft bodies from predators</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Special Functions of Animal Coverings</h3>
        <p>Animal coverings do more than just cover the body—they have specialized functions:</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="crab.jpg" alt="A crab showing its hard protective shell and claws">
            <p class="caption">This crab's hard exoskeleton provides essential protection for its soft internal organs. Its claws serve multiple functions including defense, feeding, and communication.</p>
        </div>
        
        <ul>
            <li><span class="key-concept">Protection:</span> A crab's hard shell shields its body from predators and harsh environmental conditions</li>
            <li><span class="key-concept">Camouflage:</span> Zebras have distinctive stripe patterns that, when they're in a group, make it difficult for predators to isolate a single animal</li>
            <li><span class="key-concept">Temperature regulation:</span> Fur traps air to provide insulation in cold weather</li>
            <li><span class="key-concept">Breathing:</span> Frogs can absorb oxygen through their thin, moist skin, combining protection with respiration</li>
            <li><span class="key-concept">Waterproofing:</span> Duck feathers have special oils that repel water</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="think-about-it">
            <p><strong>Think About It:</strong> If you were to design an animal for a very cold environment, what type of covering would you give it? What about for a hot desert? How would these coverings help the animal survive?</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Specialized Structures: Beaks, Opposable Thumbs, and More</h2>
        
        <h3>Beaks</h3>
        <p>Birds have beaks (or bills) adapted to their diet and lifestyle:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Woodpeckers have strong, chisel-like beaks for drilling into trees</li>
            <li>Hummingbirds have long, thin beaks for reaching deep into flowers</li>
            <li>Eagles have sharp, hooked beaks for tearing meat</li>
            <li>Cockatoos, like the one pictured above, have strong curved beaks perfect for cracking open nuts and seeds</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Opposable Thumbs</h3>
        <p>Humans and other primates have opposable thumbs that can touch the tips of other fingers. This special structure allows for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Precise gripping of objects</li>
            <li>Using tools</li>
            <li>Opening containers</li>
            <li>Manipulating small objects</li>
            <li>Using complex tools like scissors</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="activity">
            <p><strong>Quick Activity:</strong> Try to pick up a small object without using your thumb. Then try again using your thumb. How does having an opposable thumb help you interact with your environment?</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>External Structures Working Together</h2>
        <p>It's important to understand that external structures don't work in isolation—they form systems that work together to help animals survive:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>A monkey uses its <span class="key-concept">tail</span> to hang from a branch, freeing its <span class="key-concept">hands</span> (with opposable thumbs) to gather and eat food</li>
            <li>An armadillo uses its <span class="key-concept">claws</span> to dig in soil, while its <span class="key-concept">hard shell</span> protects it from predators that might attack while it's vulnerable and digging</li>
            <li>A crab's <span class="key-concept">hard shell</span>, <span class="key-concept">claws</span>, and <span class="key-concept">legs</span> work together as a complete protection and survival system</li>
            <li>A bird's <span class="key-concept">wings</span>, <span class="key-concept">feathers</span>, <span class="key-concept">hollow bones</span>, and <span class="key-concept">beak</span> all work together as a system for flight and feeding</li>
            <li>A frog's <span class="key-concept">powerful legs</span> and <span class="key-concept">permeable skin</span> work together—one for movement and the other for breathing</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="think-about-it">
            <p><strong>Think About It:</strong> Looking at the crab image above, how do you think its hard shell, claws, and legs work together as a system to help it survive? What would happen if it was missing one of these parts?</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Summary: Structure and Function</h2>
        <p>The external parts of animals are perfectly designed for their specific needs and environments. Each structure has a function (or multiple functions) that helps the animal survive. Understanding the relationship between structure and function helps us appreciate the amazing diversity of adaptations in the animal world.</p>
        
        <p>Remember these key points:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>External structures are any parts on the outside of an animal's body</li>
            <li>Animals like the tarantula have different numbers of legs depending on their species and movement needs</li>
            <li>Claws help animals like the armadillo dig, climb, catch prey, and defend themselves</li>
            <li>Tails assist with balance, movement, defense, and other specialized functions, as we saw with the monkey's prehensile tail</li>
            <li>Animal coverings (skin, fur, feathers like the cockatoo's, scales, shells like the crab's) provide protection, warmth, and sometimes camouflage</li>
            <li>Specialized structures like beaks and opposable thumbs serve specific functions</li>
            <li>External structures work together as systems to help animals survive in their environments</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="activity">
            <p><strong>Final Challenge:</strong> Choose one of the animals we've seen in our images (tarantula, armadillo, monkey, cockatoo, or crab). Make a list of its external structures and describe how each one helps the animal survive. Then, explain how these structures work together as a system!</p>
