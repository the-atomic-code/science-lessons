        <h1>Amazing Plant Parts: How Plants Survive and Thrive</h1>
        
        <p>Did you know that plants are some of the most incredible living organisms on our planet? Just like you, plants are alive! They grow, need food and water, and can even make more of themselves. In this lesson, we'll explore the amazing external parts of plants and discover how each part helps plants survive and thrive.</p>

        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="parts_of_plant.jpg" alt="Diagram showing the main parts of a plant">
            <p class="image-caption">The main external parts of a plant: roots, stem, leaves, flowers, and fruits.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>What Are External Plant Parts?</h2>
        
        <p>External plant parts are the structures you can see on the outside of a plant. These include the <span class="key-point">stem, leaves, flowers, fruits, and roots</span>. Each part has specific jobs that help the plant grow, survive, and reproduce.</p>
        
        <div class="fun-fact">
            <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Many of the foods we eat every day are actually different parts of plants!
        </div>

        <h2>The Stem: The Plant's Support System</h2>
        
        <p>The stem is like the backbone of a plant. It has two main jobs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Support:</strong> The stem is strong and helps hold the plant upright.</li>
            <li><strong>Transport:</strong> It carries water and nutrients from the roots up to the leaves.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="stems_holding_plants_up_1.jpg" alt="Plant stems providing structural support">
            <p class="image-caption">Strong stems help plants stand tall and reach for sunlight.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="stems_holding_plants_up_2.jpg" alt="Close-up of plant stems showing their structure">
            <p class="image-caption">Different plants have different types of stems to support their growth patterns.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="fun-fact">
            <strong>Edible Stems:</strong> We eat many plant stems! Some examples include celery, asparagus, and sugar cane.
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">
            <strong>Think About It:</strong> What might happen to a plant if its stem was damaged? How would this affect the plant's ability to get water to its leaves?
        </div>

        <h2>Leaves: The Food Factories</h2>
        
        <p>Leaves are like tiny solar panels for plants. Their main job is to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Collect sunlight</strong> to make food for the plant through a process called photosynthesis</li>
            <li>Turn sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into food (sugar) and oxygen</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="leaves.jpg" alt="Various plant leaves showing different shapes and structures">
            <p class="image-caption">Leaves come in many different shapes and sizes, but they all help plants capture sunlight.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Leaves come in many different shapes and sizes, but most are flat and green to maximize the amount of sunlight they can absorb.</p>
        
        <div class="fun-fact">
            <strong>Edible Leaves:</strong> Many delicious foods are actually leaves, such as mint, spinach, lettuce, and cabbage.
        </div>
        
        <div class="activity">
            <strong>Mini Activity:</strong> Look at different leaves outside or in pictures. How are they similar? How are they different? Why might some plants have large leaves while others have small ones?
        </div>

        <h2>Flowers: The Reproduction Centers</h2>
        
        <p>Flowers are the reproductive parts of plants. Their main jobs are to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Produce seeds</strong> that can grow into new plants</li>
            <li><strong>Attract pollinators</strong> like bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="flowers.jpg" alt="Colorful flowers showing their structure">
            <p class="image-caption">Flowers are colorful to attract pollinators that help with plant reproduction.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Flowers are often colorful and fragrant to attract animals that help with pollination. When animals visit flowers to collect nectar, they accidentally transfer pollen from one flower to another, helping plants reproduce.</p>
        
        <div class="fun-fact">
            <strong>Edible Flowers:</strong> Some flowers are edible and used in cooking, such as lavender, roses, broccoli florets, and cauliflower.
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">
            <strong>Think About It:</strong> Why are flowers often brightly colored? How does this help the plant survive as a species?
        </div>

        <h2>Fruits: The Seed Protectors</h2>
        
        <p>Fruits develop from flowers after pollination. They have two important jobs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Protect seeds</strong> from damage as they develop</li>
            <li><strong>Help disperse seeds</strong> to new locations</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="apricots.jpg" alt="Apricots showing fruits protecting seeds inside">
            <p class="image-caption">Apricots are fruits that protect seeds and attract animals for seed dispersal.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="apples.jpg" alt="Apples showing another type of fruit">
            <p class="image-caption">Apples are fruits that contain seeds at their core.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Many fruits are sweet and tasty to encourage animals to eat them. When animals eat fruits, they often carry the seeds away in their digestive systems and deposit them in new locations through their waste. This helps plants spread to new areas!</p>
        
        <div class="fun-fact">
            <strong>Did You Know?</strong> From a scientific perspective, many foods we consider "vegetables" are actually fruits! Tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, and squash are all fruits because they contain seeds.
        </div>
        
        <div class="activity">
            <strong>Mini Activity:</strong> Think about how different fruits disperse their seeds. How do apples, coconuts, and dandelions spread their seeds differently?
        </div>

        <h2>Roots: The Underground Anchors</h2>
        
        <p>Roots are usually hidden underground, but they're essential for plant survival. Roots have several important jobs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Absorb water and minerals</strong> from the soil</li>
            <li><strong>Anchor the plant</strong> firmly in the ground so it doesn't fall over</li>
            <li><strong>Store food</strong> in some plants</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="roots_1.jpg" alt="Plant roots showing their structure underground">
            <p class="image-caption">Roots anchor plants in the soil and absorb water and nutrients.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="roots_2.jpg" alt="Close-up of plant root system">
            <p class="image-caption">Root systems can be complex and extensive, reaching far into the soil.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Root systems can be shallow or deep depending on the plant and its environment. Plants in dry areas often have deep roots to reach water far below the surface.</p>
        
        <div class="fun-fact">
            <strong>Edible Roots:</strong> Many delicious foods are actually roots, such as carrots, beets, radishes, and potatoes (technically tubers, which are specialized underground stems, but they grow beneath the soil like roots).
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">
            <strong>Think About It:</strong> How would a plant with damaged roots be affected? What might happen to it during a windstorm or drought?
        </div>

        <h2>How Plant Parts Work Together as a System</h2>
        
        <p>All these plant parts don't work alone—they form an amazing system where each part depends on the others:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Roots</strong> absorb water and minerals from soil</li>
            <li><strong>Stems</strong> transport water and nutrients to leaves</li>
            <li><strong>Leaves</strong> use sunlight to make food</li>
            <li>Food travels through the stem to all parts of the plant</li>
            <li><strong>Flowers</strong> use this energy to produce seeds</li>
            <li><strong>Fruits</strong> develop to protect seeds and help them disperse</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>This amazing system allows plants to grow, respond to their environment, and reproduce—all characteristics of living things!</p>

        <h2>Plant Parts We Eat</h2>
        
        <p>Humans eat many different plant parts. Here's a summary of edible plant parts with examples:</p>
        
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Plant Part</th>
                <th>Examples We Eat</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Stems</td>
                <td>Celery, asparagus, sugar cane, rhubarb</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Leaves</td>
                <td>Spinach, lettuce, cabbage, mint, basil</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Flowers</td>
                <td>Broccoli, cauliflower, artichoke, lavender, roses</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Fruits</td>
                <td>Apples, tomatoes, cucumbers, dragon fruit, apricots</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Roots</td>
                <td>Carrots, beets, radishes, turnips, sweet potatoes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Seeds</td>
                <td>Corn, beans, rice, wheat, sunflower seeds</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>How Do We Know Plants Are Alive?</h2>
        
        <p>Plants show several characteristics that tell us they are living organisms:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>They grow</strong> - Plants start as seeds and develop into mature plants</li>
            <li><strong>They need nutrients</strong> - Plants require water, sunlight, and minerals to survive</li>
            <li><strong>They reproduce</strong> - Plants can make more of their own kind through seeds</li>
            <li><strong>They respond to their environment</strong> - Plants can grow toward light or away from gravity</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Plant Adaptations for Survival</h2>
        
        <p>Plants have amazing adaptations in their external structures that help them survive in different environments:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Desert plants</strong> often have small or no leaves to reduce water loss, and deep roots to reach water</li>
            <li><strong>Water plants</strong> may have air-filled stems to help them float and broad leaves to collect maximum sunlight</li>
            <li><strong>Plants in windy areas</strong> often have flexible stems that bend rather than break</li>
            <li><strong>Plants in cold regions</strong> might have needle-like leaves that resist freezing</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="question">
            <strong>Think About It:</strong> If you were designing a plant for a very dry environment, what features would you give its roots, stems, and leaves to help it survive?
        </div>
