        <h1>The Amazing World of Senses</h1>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Introduction to Senses</h2>
            <p>Senses are the ways that living things detect what is happening around them. For humans and many animals, the five basic senses are sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. These senses help us gather information about our environment, which is crucial for our survival.</p>
            
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="Brain_Visual_Processing_Lightbulb_Connection.jpg" alt="Brain processing visual information">
                <p class="image-caption">Our brain processes visual information and connects it to our understanding of the world</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>What are senses?</h3>
                <p>Senses refer to the ability to gather information about the world around us. Our sense receptors send signals to the brain. The brain analyzes the sensory information and tells the body what to do in response. Animals use sensory information to find food, avoid danger, and find mates.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Nervous System: Our Body's Information Highway</h2>
            <p>Information collected through the senses is processed by the nervous system. The nervous system is made up of our brain, spinal cord, and a network of nerves spread throughout the body.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>Components of the Nervous System:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="vocabulary-term">Brain:</span> The control center that processes all sensory information and decides how to respond</li>
                    <li><span class="vocabulary-term">Spinal Cord:</span> The main pathway for signals traveling between the brain and the rest of the body</li>
                    <li><span class="vocabulary-term">Nerves:</span> Bundle of fibers that send electrical signals to and from the brain</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <p>Our eyes, ears, nose, and other sensory organs have special structures that collect information and send it to the brain through the nervous system. The brain tells us how to act and react to sensory information. The nerves work like wires, sending electrical signals to and from the brain.</p>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <h3>Example: Frog's Hearing System</h3>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="frog_ear.jpg" alt="Frog's ear structure">
                    <p class="image-caption">A frog's specialized ear structure helps it detect sounds from predators and potential mates</p>
                </div>
                <p>Frogs have an amazing sense of hearing. When a frog's ears detect another frog making noise, the ears send this information to the brain. The brain processes this information and tells the frog how to respond. That response might be to move away from another frog's territory, or to move toward the sound if looking for a mate. Frogs also hear and respond to many other sounds that help them locate food and avoid predators.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Senses for Survival</h2>
            <p>Animals use sensory information to help them survive. When sensory information is gathered and sent to the brain, the brain tells the animal how to respond. That response could be to run from predators, find food, or locate a mate.</p>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <h3>Example: Chameleon's Special Eyes</h3>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="chameleon_eyes.jpg" alt="Chameleon's independently moving eyes">
                    <p class="image-caption">A chameleon's eyes can move independently, allowing it to look in two different directions at once</p>
                </div>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="veiled_chameleon.jpg" alt="Veiled chameleon on a branch">
                    <p class="image-caption">A veiled chameleon using its specialized eyes to survey its surroundings</p>
                </div>
                <p>Chameleons have a unique sense of sight. They are able to see in almost every direction because their eyes can move independently. This means one eye can look forward while the other eye looks backward! This amazing adaptation helps chameleons spot both predators and prey, giving them a full 360-degree view of their surroundings. If a chameleon spots a predator with one eye, it can quickly hide while still keeping track of insects to eat with its other eye.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Specialized Sensory Structures in Animals</h2>
            <p>While most animals have the same five basic senses we have (sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch), the way they gather this information can be very different. Some animals have more heightened senses than humans, and others have developed specialized structures for sensing things we cannot.</p>

                    <p class="image-caption">Termites following a chemical scent trail laid down by other termites</p>
                </div>
                <p>Termites follow scent trails laid down by other termites. When a termite finds food, it leaves a chemical trail on its way back to the nest. Other termites detect this chemical with their sense of smell and follow the trail to the food source. This efficient system helps the entire colony find nutrition.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Different Responses to Sensory Information</h2>
            <p>Animals may respond differently to the same sensory information. Some responses are instinctual (animals are born knowing how to do them), while others are learned through experience.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>Types of Sensory Responses:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="vocabulary-term">Instinctual Responses:</span> Behaviors that animals are born knowing how to do, like a baby turtle knowing to head toward the ocean.</li>
                    <li><span class="vocabulary-term">Learned Responses:</span> Behaviors that animals develop through experience and training.</li>
                    <li><span class="vocabulary-term">Seasonal Responses:</span> When fall approaches, some birds sense the changing temperature, daylight, and smells, and migrate south. Other animals like bears respond to the same sensory cues by hibernating instead.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                </div>
                <p>Dogs can be trained to respond to specific sounds like whistles. A dog is not born knowing that a high-pitched whistle means "come here for food." Through training, it learns to associate that sound with a reward, showing how animals can develop new responses to sensory information.</p>

        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>How Sensory Systems Work Together</h2>
            <p>Animals rarely use just one sense at a time. Instead, multiple senses work together as an integrated system to help animals survive.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>Integrated Sensory Systems:</h3>
                <p>When a shark hunts, it uses multiple senses in sequence:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>First, it might smell blood from far away (smell)</li>
                    <li>As it gets closer, it can detect vibrations from a struggling fish (touch receptors)</li>
                    <li>In murky water, it can sense the electrical field of the prey's muscle movements (electroreception)</li>
                    <li>Finally, it might use its vision to make the final strike (sight)</li>
                </ol>
                <p>This coordinated use of multiple sensory systems makes sharks incredibly effective predators.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Reaction Time and Survival</h2>
            <p>How quickly an animal can respond to sensory information is crucial for survival. This is called reaction time.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>Factors Affecting Reaction Time:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Health status (sick, tired, hungry)</li>
                    <li>Emotional state (scared, relaxed)</li>
                    <li>Age</li>
                    <li>Practice and experience</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <p>When animals sense danger, their bodies often respond with a "fight or flight" reaction. Their bodies release adrenaline, which speeds up their reaction time so they can either run away faster or fight more strongly against threats.</p>
            
            <div class="fun-fact">
                <p>Did you know? Your brain creates special nerve pathways for actions you practice repeatedly. This is why practice can improve your reaction times in sports, video games, or other activities!</p>
