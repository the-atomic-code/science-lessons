<h1>Body systems: digestion</h1>
<p>Let’s go on a journey through the digestive system of animals! From chewing crunchy leaves to digesting juicy prey, the digestive system is essential for animals to stay active and healthy. In this fun, detailed lesson, you’ll discover all the fascinating organs involved, how food is broken down, and even meet some helpful tiny microorganisms!</p>

<div class="section">
    <h2>What is the Digestive System and Why Is It Important?</h2>
    <p>The digestive system is like a <span class="important">processing factory</span> inside the body. When animals eat, food goes through several stages to be broken down into <span class="important">nutrients</span>. These nutrients give animals the <span class="important">energy</span> they need to play, run, grow, and heal. Without digestion, animals wouldn’t be able to get the fuel they need to survive!</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Meet the Main Organs of the Digestive System!</h2>
    <p>Let’s explore the key players in this digestive adventure:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mouth:</strong> Where food enters the body and is chewed into smaller bits.</li>
        <li><strong>Esophagus:</strong> A stretchy tube that carries food down to the stomach.</li>
        <li><strong>Stomach:</strong> A muscular bag that churns and mixes food with acids and enzymes.</li>
        <li><strong>Small Intestine:</strong> The place where nutrients are absorbed into the blood.</li>
        <li><strong>Large Intestine:</strong> Where water is absorbed, and leftover waste is formed.</li>
        <li><strong>Anus:</strong> The final stop, where waste leaves the body.</li>
    </ul>

<div class="section">
    <h2>The Secret Ingredients: Mechanical and Chemical Digestion</h2>
    <h3>Mechanical Digestion: The Physical Breakdown</h3>
    <p><span class="important">Mechanical digestion</span> is like mashing and tearing food into smaller pieces! Animals chew food in the mouth using their <strong>teeth</strong> to make it easier to swallow. In the <strong>stomach</strong>, powerful muscles churn the food around, just like a washing machine!</p>

    <h3>Chemical Digestion: Science in Action</h3>
    <p><span class="important">Chemical digestion</span> uses special tools called <strong>enzymes</strong> and <strong>acids</strong>. These chemicals break food down into <strong>tiny molecules</strong> that the body can use. This happens mainly in the stomach and small intestine.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>How Does the Body Absorb Nutrients?</h2>
    <p>After food is broken down, it travels into the <span class="important">small intestine</span>. Here, tiny finger-like structures called <strong>villi</strong> cover the walls of the intestine, making it easier to absorb nutrients into the <strong>bloodstream</strong>. Each villus is covered in even smaller projections called <strong>microvilli</strong>, giving the intestine a huge surface area for absorption!</p>
    <img src="nutrient_absorption.jpg" alt="Diagram of nutrient absorption in the small intestine, showing villi and microvilli transporting nutrients into the bloodstream." />
    <p class="caption">Diagram: Villi and microvilli in the small intestine absorbing nutrients into the bloodstream.</p>
    <p>Picture the villi and microvilli as millions of tiny fingers, grabbing nutrients and passing them into the bloodstream. This way, the body gets everything it needs—proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals!</p>

    <h2>Animal Digestive Systems: Compare and Contrast</h2>
    <p>Different animals have digestive systems that suit their diets and body types:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Animal Type</th>
            <th>Diet</th>
            <th>Digestive Adaptation</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Herbivores</td>
            <td>Plants</td>
            <td>Long intestines to break down fiber-rich plants.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Carnivores</td>
            <td>Meat</td>
            <td>Shorter intestines and strong stomach acids.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Omnivores</td>
            <td>Plants and Meat</td>
            <td>A mix of herbivore and carnivore features.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Birds</td>
            <td>Seeds, insects</td>
            <td>Use a gizzard to grind food since they have no teeth.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Vertebrates</td>
            <td>Varies (plants, meat, or both)</td>
            <td>Complex digestive systems with specialized organs like a stomach and intestines.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Invertebrates</td>
            <td>Varies (leaves, small insects, or organic material)</td>
            <td>Simpler digestive systems; some absorb nutrients directly through their body walls.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Say Hello to the Liver and Pancreas!</h2>
    <p>The <strong>liver</strong> and <strong>pancreas</strong> are like the digestive system’s best friends:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The <span class="important">liver</span> produces <strong>bile</strong>, a liquid that helps digest fat.</li>
        <li>The <span class="important">pancreas</span> makes <strong>enzymes</strong> that break down food in the small intestine.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Helpful Microorganisms: Tiny Friends in the Gut</h2>
    <p>Some <span class="important">microorganisms</span> live inside the intestines and help break down food. They are part of the <strong>gut microbiome</strong> and are very important for keeping the digestive system healthy!</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>The Last Step: Waste Elimination</h2>
    <p>Not everything in the food can be used. The leftovers move into the <span class="important">large intestine</span> where water is absorbed. What’s left turns into waste, which exits the body through the <strong>anus</strong> as feces!</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Common Digestive Problems and Staying Healthy</h2>
    <p>Just like humans, animals can have <strong>digestive issues</strong> too. Here are some common ones:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Indigestion:</strong> Food isn’t digested properly, causing discomfort.</li>
        <li><strong>Constipation:</strong> Waste moves too slowly, making it hard to pass.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To keep the digestive system healthy, animals (and people!) need a <span class="important">balanced diet</span>, plenty of <strong>water</strong>, and <strong>exercise</strong>.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>The Big Picture: Why Is the Digestive System Important?</h2>
    <p>The digestive system is essential for keeping animals <span class="important">alive</span> and <span class="important">active</span>. Without it, animals wouldn’t be able to get the energy they need to grow, move, or heal. It’s truly a magical system!</p>
