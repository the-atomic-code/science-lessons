<h1>🌎 Earth's Amazing Makeover: Discover How Landforms Are Shaped! 🏔️</h1>

<div class="container">
<div class="intro">
    <h2>Ready for an Exciting Journey? 🚀</h2>
    <p>Get ready to explore how Mother Nature sculpts our planet! We'll discover the amazing forces that create mountains, valleys, canyons, and more. Think of Earth as a giant art project that's constantly being reshaped by wind, water, and ice. Let's dive in and uncover these fascinating processes!</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <div class="question-number">Question 1: The Earth's Natural Sculptors 🎨</div>
    What are the three main processes that act like nature's sculptors to shape Earth's surface?
    <br>
    <button class="toggle-btn" id="btn1" onclick="toggleAnswer(1)">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="answer1">Weathering, erosion, and deposition are Earth's natural sculptors! Think of them as a team:
    <ul>
        <li>Weathering: Breaks down the rocks (like a hammer)</li>
        <li>Erosion: Moves the pieces (like a conveyor belt)</li>
        <li>Deposition: Places them in new locations (like a careful artist)</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <div class="question-number">Question 2: Nature's Demolition Crew 🏗️</div>
    What exactly is weathering, and how does it work its magic on rocks?
    <br>
    <button class="toggle-btn" id="btn2" onclick="toggleAnswer(2)">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="answer2">Weathering is nature's demolition crew! It's the process where rocks are broken down into smaller pieces. Imagine it as nature's way of turning big rocks into little rocks, just like breaking a cookie into crumbs!</div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <div class="question-number">Question 3: Earth's Moving Company 🚛</div>
    What is erosion, and why is it so important?
    <br>
    <button class="toggle-btn" id="btn3" onclick="toggleAnswer(3)">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="answer3">Erosion is like Earth's moving company! It's the process that transports rocks and sediments from one place to another. Think of it as nature's delivery service, using wind, water, and ice as its delivery trucks!</div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <div class="question-number">Question 4: Nature's Building Blocks 🏗️</div>
    What happens during deposition, and why is it crucial for creating new landforms?
    <br>
    <button class="toggle-btn" id="btn4" onclick="toggleAnswer(4)">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="answer4">Deposition is like nature's construction work! It occurs when sediments are dropped off in new locations, building new landforms. Think of it as Mother Nature's way of playing with building blocks, creating new structures from materials she's moved around.</div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <div class="question-number">Question 5: Nature's Toolbox 🛠️</div>
    What are the three main natural forces that cause weathering and erosion?
    <br>
    <button class="toggle-btn" id="btn5" onclick="toggleAnswer(5)">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="answer5">Nature uses three powerful tools:
    <ul>
        <li>Wind: The aerial sculptor 🌪️</li>
        <li>Water: The liquid carver 💧</li>
        <li>Ice: The frozen chisel ❄️</li>
    </ul>
    Each of these forces works in its own unique way to shape our planet's surface!</div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <div class="question-number">Question 6: River Power 🌊</div>
    How do rivers contribute to weathering?
    <br>
    <button class="toggle-btn" id="btn6" onclick="toggleAnswer(6)">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="answer6">Rivers are like nature's sandpaper! As water flows, it carries small rocks and sand that act like tiny chisels, scratching and scraping against larger rocks. Over time, this constant scratching breaks down even the toughest rocks - just like how sandpaper smooths rough wood!</div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <div class="question-number">Question 7: Ice Power ❄️</div>
    How does ice break down rocks?
    <br>
    <button class="toggle-btn" id="btn7" onclick="toggleAnswer(7)">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="answer7">Ice is nature's demolition expert! When water seeps into rock cracks and freezes, it expands with incredible force - enough to split rocks apart! This process is called "frost wedging," and it's like having tiny ice wedges working to split rocks from the inside out.</div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <div class="question-number">Question 8: Delta Mystery 🏝️</div>
    What's a delta, and how does nature build one?
    <br>
    <button class="toggle-btn" id="btn8" onclick="toggleAnswer(8)">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="answer8">A delta is like nature's fan-shaped sandbox! It forms when rivers meet larger bodies of water and drop their sediment load. Imagine dumping sand into water - it spreads out in a triangle shape. That's exactly how deltas form at river mouths, creating new land where water and earth meet!</div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <div class="question-number">Question 9: Desert Architects 🏜️</div>
    How do sand dunes form in deserts?
    <br>
    <button class="toggle-btn" id="btn9" onclick="toggleAnswer(9)">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="answer9">Sand dunes are nature's sand castles! They form when wind picks up loose sand and deposits it in new locations. As more sand accumulates, the dunes grow larger. It's like watching a giant natural conveyor belt of sand, creating waves of earth across the desert!</div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <div class="question-number">Question 10: Canyon Creation 🏞️</div>
    How are massive canyons carved into the Earth?
    <br>
    <button class="toggle-btn" id="btn10" onclick="toggleAnswer(10)">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="answer10">Canyons are nature's masterpiece sculptures! They're formed when rivers persistently cut through rock layers over millions of years. Imagine water as nature's carving tool, slowly but surely cutting deeper and deeper into the Earth, creating magnificent deep valleys with steep walls.</div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <div class="question-number">Question 11: Valley Shapes 🏔️</div>
    Why do some valleys look like a 'V' while others look like a 'U'?
    <br>
    <button class="toggle-btn" id="btn11" onclick="toggleAnswer(11)">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="answer11">It's all about the sculptor!
    <ul>
        <li>V-shaped valleys: Carved by rivers cutting down into the land</li>
        <li>U-shaped valleys: Scooped out by massive glaciers moving slowly like frozen bulldozers</li>
    </ul>
    Each leaves its own signature shape in the landscape!</div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <div class="question-number">Question 12: Time's Role ⏳</div>
    Why does erosion usually take so long?
    <br>
    <button class="toggle-btn" id="btn12" onclick="toggleAnswer(12)">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="answer12">Erosion is like a very patient artist! It works grain by grain, bit by bit, slowly sculpting the landscape. While a single raindrop might not do much, millions of raindrops over thousands of years can carve canyons and shape mountains. Nature teaches us that small actions, repeated over time, can create amazing results!</div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <div class="question-number">Question 13: Wind Power 🌪️</div>
    How does wind shape the land?
    <br>
    <button class="toggle-btn" id="btn13" onclick="toggleAnswer(13)">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="answer13">Wind is Earth's invisible sculptor! It picks up small particles and hurls them against rocks, acting like nature's sandblasting machine. This process, called abrasion, slowly wears away at rocks and creates fascinating shapes in desert landscapes. It's like having millions of tiny hammers constantly chipping away at the rocks!</div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <div class="question-number">Question 14: Sediment Stories 🏺</div>
    Why are sediments so important in creating landforms?
    <br>
    <button class="toggle-btn" id="btn14" onclick="toggleAnswer(14)">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="answer14">Sediments are like nature's building blocks! They play three crucial roles:
    <ul>
        <li>They're the pieces left after weathering breaks down rocks</li>
        <li>They're the passengers during erosion's transport</li>
        <li>They're the building materials used in deposition to create new landforms</li>
    </ul>
    Without sediments, we wouldn't have beaches, deltas, or many other beautiful landforms!</div>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <div class="question-number">Question 15: The Big Picture 🌍</div>
    Why is understanding landform formation important?
    <br>
    <button class="toggle-btn" id="btn15" onclick="toggleAnswer(15)">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="answer" id="answer15">Understanding landform formation is like having a crystal ball into Earth's future! It helps us:
    <ul>
        <li>Predict how landscapes might change</li>
        <li>Protect communities from natural hazards</li>
        <li>Plan better cities and infrastructure</li>
        <li>Preserve our beautiful natural wonders</li>
