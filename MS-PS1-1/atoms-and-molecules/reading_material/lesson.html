    <h1>Atoms & Molecules: The Building Blocks of Matter</h1>
    
    <div class="highlight-box">
        <p>Welcome to your journey into the microscopic world of atoms and molecules! In this lesson, you'll discover the fundamental particles that make up everything around us - from the air you breathe to the device you're using to read this text.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. What is Atomic Structure?</h2>
    
    <p>Everything in our universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. But what exactly are atoms made of?</p>
    
    <p>All atoms are composed of three fundamental subatomic particles:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Protons</strong>: Positively charged particles located in the center of an atom</li>
        <li><strong>Neutrons</strong>: Particles with no charge (neutral) also located in the center of an atom</li>
        <li><strong>Electrons</strong>: Negatively charged particles that orbit the center of the atom at tremendous speed and distance</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="atom_outline.jpg" alt="Basic atomic structure diagram">
        <p class="caption">Basic outline of an atom showing electrons orbiting a nucleus</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>The center of the atom is called the <strong>nucleus</strong>. This is where protons and neutrons clump together. Electrons orbit around the nucleus at great distances relative to the size of the nucleus.</p>
    
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="labeled_atomic_structure.jpg" alt="Labeled atomic structure showing protons, neutrons, and electrons">
        <p class="caption">Labeled atomic structure showing protons (positive), neutrons (neutral), and electrons (negative)</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="fun-fact">
        Most of an atom is empty space! If an atom were the size of a football stadium, the nucleus would be about the size of a pea in the center, with electrons like tiny gnats flying around the outer stands.
    </div>
    
    <div class="check-understanding">

        <p>What are the three fundamental particles that make up an atom?</p>
        <p>Where are protons and neutrons located in an atom?</p>
        <p>What is the charge of each subatomic particle?</p>
    </div>

    <h2>2. How Small Are Atoms?</h2>
    
    <p>Atoms are incredibly tiny - more than 10,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair! They're so small that even powerful classroom microscopes can't see them.</p>
    
    <p>Special microscopes called Scanning Tunneling Microscopes (developed in the 1980s) are needed to visualize individual atoms. If you looked at iron filings with one of these microscopes, you would see tiny spheres - these are the individual iron atoms!</p>

    <div class="fun-fact">
        There are more atoms in a single glass of water than there are glasses of water in all the oceans of the Earth combined!

    <h2>3. Understanding Matter: Elements, Compounds, and Mixtures</h2>
    
    <p>To understand matter, we need to know the relationship between atoms, elements, molecules, compounds, and mixtures:</p>

        </tr>
    </table>
    
    <p><strong>Key differences:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Elements contain only one type of atom; compounds contain multiple types of atoms chemically bonded together</li>
        <li>All compounds are molecules, but not all molecules are compounds (e.g., O₂ is a molecule but not a compound because it contains only one element)</li>
        <li>Compounds have fixed ratios of elements; mixtures can have variable compositions</li>
        <li>Mixtures can be separated by physical means; compounds can only be separated by chemical reactions</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>4. Elements: Nature's Building Blocks</h2>
    
    <p>An <strong>element</strong> is a pure substance that consists of only one type of atom. Each element has unique properties and can't be broken down into simpler substances by normal chemical means.</p>
    
    <p>There are 118 known elements, and they're all organized in the Periodic Table of Elements. Examples include:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Hydrogen (H)</li>
        <li>Carbon (C)</li>
        <li>Oxygen (O)</li>
        <li>Gold (Au)</li>
        <li>Iron (Fe)</li>

        <p class="caption">The Periodic Table of Elements organizes all known elements by their properties and atomic structure</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>The smallest unit of an element that still maintains the properties of that element is an <strong>atom</strong>. For example, the smallest piece of gold that is still gold is a gold atom.</p>

        <h3>Quick Check:</h3>
        <p>What is an element?</p>
        <p>What is the smallest unit of an element?</p>
        <p>Where can you find all the known elements organized?</p>
    </div>

    <h2>5. Identifying Atoms Using the Periodic Table</h2>
    
    <p>Each element on the periodic table has a unique number of protons, neutrons, and electrons. We can use the periodic table to find this information.</p>
    
    <p>The <strong>atomic number</strong> of an element tells us:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The number of protons in each atom of that element</li>
        <li>The number of electrons in each neutral atom of that element</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>For example, carbon has an atomic number of 6. This means:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Every carbon atom has 6 protons</li>
        <li>Every neutral carbon atom has 6 electrons</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="activity">
        <h3>Element Exploration Activity</h3>
        <p>Find these elements on the periodic table and determine their atomic numbers:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Oxygen (O)</li>
            <li>Helium (He)</li>
            <li>Sodium (Na)</li>
            <li>Iron (Fe)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>For each element, write down how many protons and electrons it has.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>6. From Atoms to Molecules</h2>
    
    <p>When two or more atoms bond together, they form a <strong>molecule</strong>. A molecule is the smallest particle of a compound that still maintains the properties of that compound.</p>
    
    <p>Molecules can be simple or extremely complex:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Water (H<sub>2</sub>O)</strong>: 2 hydrogen atoms bonded to 1 oxygen atom</li>
        <li><strong>Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)</strong>: 1 carbon atom bonded to 2 oxygen atoms</li>
        <li><strong>Table sugar (C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>)</strong>: 12 carbon atoms, 22 hydrogen atoms, and 11 oxygen atoms</li>
        <li><strong>Hemoglobin</strong>: Contains thousands of atoms arranged in a specific structure</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="water_oxygen_carbondioxide_molecules.jpg" alt="Models of water, oxygen, and carbon dioxide molecules">
        <p class="caption">Models of common molecules: water (H₂O), oxygen (O₂), and carbon dioxide (CO₂)</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="fun-fact">
        Some molecules in your DNA contain billions of atoms arranged in a precise order!

        <p>What is a molecule?</p>
        <p>How many hydrogen and oxygen atoms are in a water molecule?</p>
        <p>What is the chemical formula for table sugar?</p>
    </div>

    <h2>7. Extended Structures vs. Individual Molecules</h2>
    
    <p>Substances exist in different forms depending on how their atoms and molecules arrange themselves:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Individual molecules</strong>: Some substances exist as distinct, individual molecules (like gases)</li>
        <li><strong>Extended structures</strong>: Other substances form large networks where atoms are connected in repeating patterns</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Noble gases (helium, neon): Exist as individual atoms that don't typically bond with other atoms</li>
        <li>Water (H<sub>2</sub>O): Exists as individual molecules</li>
        <li>Diamonds: Carbon atoms form an extended structure in a rigid crystal lattice</li>
        <li>Table salt (NaCl): Forms a crystalline extended structure of alternating sodium and chloride ions</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="fun-fact">
        Noble gases like helium rarely form molecules because their electron arrangement is already stable. That's why helium balloons contain individual helium atoms, not molecules.
    </div>
    
    <h2>8. Evidence for Atomic Structure</h2>
    
    <p>How do scientists know that atoms have a small dense nucleus with electrons orbiting far away?</p>
    
    <p>In 1908, scientist Ernest Rutherford conducted a famous experiment where he shot beams of radiation through gold foil. He discovered:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Most radiation passed straight through the gold foil</li>
        <li>Only a tiny fraction of the beams bounced back</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This experiment provided evidence that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Most of an atom is empty space</li>
        <li>The mass of an atom is concentrated in a small, dense nucleus</li>
        <li>The nucleus is positively charged (causing some radiation to bounce back)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>9. Chemistry: The Science of Atoms and Molecules</h2>
    
    <p>Chemistry is the scientific field that studies atoms, molecules, and their interactions. Chemists and biochemists use their knowledge of atomic structure to:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Create new medicines</li>
        <li>Develop new materials</li>
        <li>Study biological molecules like proteins and DNA</li>
        <li>Understand how living things function at the molecular level</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="chemist_in_lab.jpg" alt="Chemist working in a laboratory">
        <p class="caption">Chemists use their knowledge of atomic structure to create new molecules for medicine and other applications</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>For example, biochemists have used their understanding of molecules to produce insulin for people with diabetes. This process involves creating complex molecules that function like the insulin naturally produced by the human body.</p>
    
    <div class="activity">
        <h3>Molecule Model Building Activity</h3>
        <p>Draw models of these molecules using circles to represent atoms:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Water (H<sub>2</sub>O) - 2 hydrogen atoms and 1 oxygen atom</li>
            <li>Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) - 1 carbon atom and 2 oxygen atoms</li>
            <li>Methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) - 1 carbon atom and 4 hydrogen atoms</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Label each atom in your model. For each molecule, count the total number of atoms.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>10. How Atomic Structure Affects Molecular Properties</h2>
    
    <p>The arrangement of atoms in a molecule determines its properties. Even when molecules contain the same types and numbers of atoms, different arrangements can create molecules with completely different properties.</p>
    
    <p>For example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ethanol (drinking alcohol) and dimethyl ether have the same types and numbers of atoms (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O), but different arrangements give them very different properties</li>
        <li>Diamonds and graphite are both made entirely of carbon atoms, but their different atomic arrangements give them vastly different properties</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="check-understanding">
        <h3>Quick Check:</h3>
        <p>How does the arrangement of atoms affect a molecule's properties?</p>
        <p>Why do noble gases typically exist as individual atoms rather than forming molecules?</p>
        <p>What determines whether a substance will form an extended structure or remain as individual molecules?</p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <ul>
            <li>Atoms are the basic building blocks of all matter</li>
            <li>Atoms are made of three smaller particles: protons (positive), neutrons (neutral), and electrons (negative)</li>
            <li>Protons and neutrons form the nucleus at the center of an atom, while electrons orbit at a distance</li>
            <li>Most of an atom is empty space</li>
            <li>Elements are pure substances made of only one type of atom</li>
            <li>The periodic table organizes all known elements and provides information about their atomic structure</li>
            <li>The atomic number tells us how many protons and electrons are in an atom</li>
            <li>Molecules form when two or more atoms bond together</li>
            <li>Compounds are pure substances made of two or more different elements chemically bonded together</li>
            <li>Mixtures are combinations of substances that can be separated by physical methods</li>
            <li>Molecules can range from simple (like H<sub>2</sub>O) to extremely complex (like proteins)</li>
            <li>The arrangement of atoms in a molecule determines its properties</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Final Challenge: Application of Knowledge</h3>
        <p>Consider these questions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Why does salt (NaCl) form crystals while oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) exists as a gas at room temperature?</li>
            <li>How might changing the number of hydrogen atoms in a water molecule affect its properties?</li>
            <li>Why are metals typically good conductors of electricity based on their atomic structure?</li>
            <li>How does the molecular structure of sugar (C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>) contribute to its properties as a solid that dissolves in water?</li>
        </ol>
